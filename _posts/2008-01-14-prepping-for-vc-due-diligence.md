We're actively raising institutional money to come out of seed-stage and really get rolling. It's pretty exciting, but lots of work as well. In attempting to be as efficient as possible, we're prepping our due diligence materials in advance as much as possible. Our goal: on initiation of DD, to be able to turn around all materials as quickly as possible. To prep, here are some of the things we're doing: 

  1. Scanning to PDF all contracts, agreements (ie: ops/shares agreements), IP and pertinent financial materials (ie: Tax returns)

  2. Having out accountants perform audits on all our financials

  3. Updating and maintaining pro formas

  4. Status on technology and customer base

  5. Business plans, marketing materials, and strategic docs

We have almost all of it in soft copy now, but need to document in a consolidated format for consistency. The thing that's going to take the longest is the audited financials. We're meeting with our accountants on Wednesday to go through the how/what/when/where/cost of an audit.
