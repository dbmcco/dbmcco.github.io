# Accessing Your WordPress Content

## Current Status
✅ **Substack**: All 3 posts successfully migrated (2023)
❌ **WordPress**: `meansofproduction.wordpress.com` is private - need manual export

## Option 1: WordPress.com Export (Recommended)

1. **Log into WordPress.com**
   - Go to https://wordpress.com/log-in
   - Use your WordPress.com credentials

2. **Navigate to Export**
   - Click "My Sites" 
   - Select your site
   - Go to "Settings" → "Export"
   - Choose "Export All" or "Posts"
   - Download the XML file

## Option 2: Direct Admin Access

If you have admin access:
1. Go to https://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-admin
2. Tools → Export → All Content
3. Download XML export

## Option 3: Alternative Access Methods

**Check these locations for content:**
- Email exports you might have saved
- Local backups of posts
- WordPress app on mobile
- Copy/paste individual posts

## What I Need

Once you get the content, I can convert it automatically:

**If you get XML export:**
```bash
python migrate-wordpress.py your-export.xml
```

**If you have individual posts:**
- Send me the URLs or content
- I'll convert them manually to Jekyll format

## Next Steps

1. Try to access WordPress.com dashboard 
2. Export content to XML
3. I'll convert everything to your blog
4. Publish all your historical content

Would you like me to help you access the WordPress content a different way?
