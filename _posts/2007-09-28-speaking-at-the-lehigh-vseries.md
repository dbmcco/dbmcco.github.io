[Dale Falcinelli](http://www.lehigh.edu/~incbeug/faculty/DaleFalcinelli.htm) asked me to speak at his vSeries at Lehigh to discuss our IP strategy; he thinks what we're doing (IP wise) is really interesting. At first I thought he was joking and making fun, I mean - we have IP - so what??? Then I realized he's looking at it from the Entrepreneur's perspective. He wants to give his MBA students a chance to peer inside a fairly dynamic and innovative company in an interesting space. **[Lehigh vSeries](http://www.lehighvseries.com/)** October 19th at 8:45 AM - save the date!
