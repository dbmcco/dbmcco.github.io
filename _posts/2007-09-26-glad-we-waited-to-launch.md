Amazon.com's launch is ALL OVER the news and blogosphere. It would have been a disaster to launch rVibe in the middle of that. We're going to have to wait until at least next week to launch. And all I can say is that thank goodness the Apple backlash is starting to gain some momentum - this really really bodes well for loosening up and growing the market.
