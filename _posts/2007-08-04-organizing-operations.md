![rVibeÂ logo](http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/logo.thumbnail.jpg)When we first started up, I generated a list of Goals and Objectives, designed an organization, put together some processes for operating and generally fleshed out an entire organization for building and operating rVibe. That was two years ago - and way way way too premature. However, now that the beta is running, and we're embarking on the next phase, I've circled back to some of those original concepts and designs. Thankfully, most were pretty close and definitely usable. Some were off - but if nothing else it attests to the importance of consistency and accuracy upfront. So - the other thing it points to is having a good lawyer (which we do). [Jay](http://www.duanemorris.com/attorneys/attorney6168.html) did our operating agreement and share plan plan a long time ago - and man oh man - did he get it right. I guess what I'm saying is that we're in the process of preparing for due diligence. I'd like nothing more than to email a PDF with every applicable DD question already answered. Getting there.
