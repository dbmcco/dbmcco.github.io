For as many projects as I've been on, I should be used to it, but I'm not. Inevitably, when you near a release, a billion things come up that we not fully expected- those little details that matter so much in a consumer product. You often nail the big ticket items, but you just can't leave the little ones - they hang people up and give you a bad rap. So we have slipped out private beta 1 until Friday of this week to work on those details. And no matter how many times I see this happen, it still makes me cringe/boil/laugh/cry. The solution? Have really great developers who are both creative and thoughtful and know how to deal with issues as the arise. It just proves again why it's so important to fully vet your vendors and really interview your staff.
