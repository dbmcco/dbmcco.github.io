![EMI](http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/emilogo.thumbnail.gif)It finally happened, one of the majors has moved to [sell music without DRM](http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN0134595820070402?&src=040207_1409_DOUBLEFEATURE_top_news). We've been predicting it would happen since the end of 2005, and it was just about right. So - now what for rVibe? We'll work to re-open our negotiations EMI and get the ball rolling on a DRM-free license. It seems we should have the right pieces in place to do it - DRM-free, open format, higher quality files - not a bad story to tell. I am happy about it - I think feature to feature, rVibe competes well with Apple, Napster and the like. The major competition will really be from website based download services, but then they have other loyalty problems... More to come on how it goes.
