It's very exciting around here - we're moving forward with Sheridan Square on our licensing agreement. That means, V2, Artemis, and a host of other great labels (including the 2nd largest Gospel label in the country) will become part of the rVibe family! 50,000 awesome tracks (ie: Dave Matthews).... We're also working on some other deals with them that we're excited about - but don't want to spill the beans on... More to come soon.
