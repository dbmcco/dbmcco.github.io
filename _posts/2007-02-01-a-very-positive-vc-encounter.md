Did a phone call with Sierra Ventures today; the most refreshing VC I have ever had. The timing, tone and temper were all pitch perfect and it appeared he felt the same way. It felt like we were on the same page about the capital strategy, the launch strategy and the platform strategy. Also nice that it was initiated on their side, not by me. Granted, it's impossible to know from a 1/2 hour screen - but bigger decisions have been made on less - and you have to trust your gut. With any luck we'll do in person in the next few weeks and do follow on from there. I suspect the major contentions in due diligence will be the cost of the major labels, the clarity and how addressable our market demographic is and the distribution of our team. But, you just never know.
