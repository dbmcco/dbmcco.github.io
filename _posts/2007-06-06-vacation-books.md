Just came back from a much needed vacation - and right in the middle of getting ready for a release. Either I am crazy or I trust my team to deliver. Or both. In either case, I like to read - a lot. Mainly non-fiction these days, but on vacation I do enjoy some good escapist work. I read the [Alexandria link](http://www.amazon.com/Alexandria-Link-Novel-Steve-Berry/dp/0345485750/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-6151493-3534321?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1181161306&sr=8-1) \- it was good - not so fresh feeling, but well done, well thought out, an interesting theory and executed strongly. A little Indiana Jones, a little Da Vinci Code. Engaging and fun.

I also read [the Traveler](http://www.amazon.com/Traveler-John-Twelve-Hawks/dp/1400079292/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/104-6151493-3534321?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1181161320&sr=8-2). That felt a good deal more fresh. Not as well executed - meaning in some ways the author (whoever he/she may be) seemed to be a journalist reporting rather than a fiction writer. That can be good - but it laked a bit of richness. I still really liked it - it was very engaging and hard to put down. A secret society is trying to kill off a small group of people who, after they travel to "other realms", come back an start social revolutions.

So now that I am back - I'm back to non-fiction. I've started [Mayflower](http://www.amazon.com/Mayflower-Story-Courage-Community-War/dp/0143111973/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-6151493-3534321?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1181161562&sr=1-1). So far so good! Really is humanizing and making real the pilgrims - not as we know them, but maybe as we should.
