Very happy to say we've secured content licensing with [Sheridan Square Music](http://sheridansquaremusic.com/)! That gives us a number if great labels including V2, Artemis Records, Artemis Classics, Vanguard Classics, Triloka Records, Tone-Cool Records, Ropeadope Records and Compendia Music. Around 50,000 tracks of awesome music - very exciting! We are thrilled to distribute Sheridan content and look forward to a long and fruitful relationship. And they have been fantastic to work with - incredibly refreshing!
