We have all used software that is ugly, difficult to use and does not perform as expected. I won't name names, but you know what I mean. Sometimes we'll overlook the issues because the function they provide adds value to us, sometimes the value is not enough. In my view, even if you provide significant value, you must have all those little details working. And in a competitive consumer market, that is super critical. I am not saying that we have every detail perfect, but I just can't let rVibe go out into even a limited beta until it does those core things and does it without significant error. So we have two key bugs left that we're working on before the beta goes out (and this does not have full functionality yet) - one minor and one major: 1. Credit card processing is not accepting credit cards (it's an internal db issue - this is pretty easy) 2. p2p audition/download is not working consistently. This second one has me befuddled and frustrated. In principle it's actually a really minor problem - id an active client with the with desired track, and serve it up. The challenge is in programmatically scrolling through the clients to determine if they are active before handling an address off to the requesting client. We're getting there though - and I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.
