![rVibe logo](http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/logo.jpg)Finally, at long last, Beta 1 is here. It's not without its issues and missing funtions of course, but the core software is solid and it's the real deal. Real content, really able to purchase tracks, really real. Lots more to improve upon, and release 1&2 are already full ahead on development. Below is an excerpt from the email I sent out to our first round beta testers (password removed here of course). For everyone I've neglected to respond to emails, please accept my apologies. Starting Wednesday I hope to better about it. Hi –  The rVibe beta is finally here! Let me thank you in advance for trying it out and giving us your feedback; we really appreciate your time and thoughts, and look forward to hearing from you. And, I hope you know, as the first members, we believe you are critical to setting the stage and tone for the future of our service.  rVibe is all about the community of people that make it up and about recommendations from friends to friends. We think it’s a really friendly and helpful place, so please be sure to make plenty of friends and recommendations! Now, as excited as we are about this release, please remember that beta software _always_ has bugs, issues, and missing functions. There is _lots_ of room to improve. We value your criticisms so that we can hammer out problems, work on cosmetic issues, create new functions, and generally enhance rVibe to make it better.
