Riding the growing wave of DRM free licensing, [Wal-Mart is starting to offer DRM-free MP3s for a la carte download](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/business/la-fi-music22aug22,1,5283460.story?coll=la-headlines-business-enter). I love it and think it's great. $.93 per download with 30 second auditions. Fairly straight forward, normal store front model - just like Wal-Mart. I think this is another sign of things to come for DRM - love it. [Rhapsody and MTV](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/22/business/media/22music.html?ref=media)I don't think have a strategic sense of what this means. Companies like Real/Rhapsody or MTV's Urge or Napster that all built business models based on required DRM have a major problem on their hands, and in my view, forming a new distribution arm is not going to help. I am just glad we're moving toward a more open format for distribution. Now it lets the businesses play on more equal footing and allows for greater business model diversity in the market - which in this case is a good thing.
