Well - we've starting pitching to VC's and early stage investors in earnest now. One week ago we did a round with an early stage Angel fund, yesterday we did an on-line demo to a growth stage VC firm (not a good match - yet), we have four VCs getting lined up for the next two weeks, and six more we're dancing with to see if we should talk more. Working toward finding the right partner - and a term sheet!
