We've been doing a ton of work to get a better sense of our differentiators and value add to our users. Over and over again, our focus on giving back comes up. Thus, our language and message is changing to drive more about our charity partners - and over time our functionality will change too. In addition, we're making it clearer around "what you do when you use rVibe" so when members start up, they can get rolling faster: 

  1. Manage your own music on your computer better than before

  2. Share and buy music from your friends, or from rVibe - get rewards

  3. Give your rewards to one of our charity partners - we work better together
