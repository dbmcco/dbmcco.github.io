[![Grooveshark](http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/grooveshark.jpg?w=150)](http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/2009/06/18/i-was-wondering-when-grooveshark-would-get-sued/grooveshark/) And it happened. [Reports](http://mediamemo.allthingsd.com/20090617/another-music-startup-sued-emi-takes-grooveshark-to-court/) are [coming](http://mediamemo.allthingsd.com/20090617/another-music-startup-sued-emi-takes-grooveshark-to-court/?reflink=ATD_mktw_quotes) (WSJ) in that EMI is suing [Grooveshark](http://www.grooveshark.com/community/2009/06/17/an-announcement-from-grooveshark/#comments) for copyright infringement. I have a fondness for Grooveshark - they had a model super similar to ours at RVibe for p2p legal desktop sharing. Except that where we did file validation and restricted downloads to explicitly licensed tracks (but not non-interactive streams), they allowed them. And, I asked our lawyer over and over - does their model of "putting the paid money into an escrow account" work? His answer over and over again - it's still infringement with out a licensing agreement. So, while I admine their desire to move the industry forward, from a business intelligence and risk mitigation standpoint, they kind of blew it. At up-to $125k an infringement, and will "millions of tracks", they are in for a very rough ride. And where other companies (eg: [Imeem and their Warner (re)investment](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/06/16/paidcontent/main5091157.shtml)) were able to covert the legal morass into a licensing agreement, knowing how the major labels think, Grooveshark has too many technical/model hurdles (not to mention financial ones) to overcome to secure a deal.
