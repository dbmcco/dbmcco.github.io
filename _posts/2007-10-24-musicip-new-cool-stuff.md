MusicIP has just released their new [reporting stuff](http://www.musicip.com/reporting) and it's very cool. I chatted with Adam over there and we're going to see what we can do to move some of their new analytics into rVibe. I see it as an ad delivery play, they see it a little differently, but interested in exploring how our use of it might develop their focus. That is partnership - benefit to everyone - and I love it.
