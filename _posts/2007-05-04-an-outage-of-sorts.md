I killed my Treo 700w - aargh! Once it's gone, makes you realize how dependant you are (if you didn't know already). ![Treo](http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/brokentreo.thumbnail.jpg) So we picked up a Q and it's great - love it - exactly what I need - and back online.
