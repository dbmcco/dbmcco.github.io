![Libana](http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/libana.thumbnail.jpg)I love the [Swedish Lullaby](http://www.amazon.com/Lullaby-Collection-Various-Artists/dp/B000002M78) from [Libana](http://www.libana.com/)\- it's gorgeous. I sing it to my kids (albeit not like she does). The interesting thing about the performance is that it seems to adhere to more "folk" traditions. Meaning, the meter is not square, it seems to vary, and the speed at which she sings varies based on where she is in the tune. Also, she bends some notes at key places in a very traditional manner. I love that - we don't see much of that type of sensitivity today, and it's refreshing in a sea of 4/4 sqareness. Oh - and her straight tone is just beautiful.
