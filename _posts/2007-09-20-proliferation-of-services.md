Yes, there are definitely [many more options](http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jdpuDYbDqTXuGoeOKqBnQZ25yccw)from which to choose for music services. And there are a couple interesting models out there (ie: Spiral Frog, or Aimestreet). However, there is LOTS of room to grow. And, as I see it, at the core, these services are still centralized, web-site based services that don't differentiate all that well. Differentiation and value-add are the central keys to success in this market. I do think that as DRM loosens up, we'll see a spike in sales, however, and for that I am glad.
