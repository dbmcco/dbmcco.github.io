In our fund-raising quest, I just pitched to the [NY Angels](http://www.newyorkangels.com/) investment group. The pitch went very well: there were three screening members, one of whom clearly was familiar with the space and technology, and the other two extremely sharp on understanding the business. They were engaged, asked good questions and really got it. And I am super happy to say - they really got the differentiation - I think our message is starting to really clarify, which is great. So - who really knows with these things - I've done this enough now to realize that there are so many factors at play that have nothing to do with us - but all in all, a good pitch was had by all. They'll let us know Monday if we get invited to the breakfast.
