We've been working with Spencer over at CDBaby for well over a year now on our contract to license their content. And.... it's done - signed, complete! We're now licensed to sell CDBaby content. Well - 75% of it anyway, since we're a peer-to-peer service. Everyone over at CDBaby has been really fantastic - we're real fans and appreciate everything they do.

And here is the real kicker: NO DRM! Since our system is relatively closed (meaning we don't consume content from open p2p systems), it is really a non-issue in our view. But wow - big news for the industry - first legal p2p system with no DRM.
