One of the greatest things about a small company and even better about a startup is the ability to change strategic direction - quickly. Unlike larger corporations with large investments in human capital and infrastructure, a nimble startup can identify opportunities and action them fast. Of course, a large company typically has greater resources at their disposal, but also when there are greater resources, there is often less hunger. So - I think what that means is that smaller can be (but does not have to be) more nimble, and companies that are hungrier will move on opportunities. Of course, being nimble and moving doesn't do much good unless there is a vision to align to - you can't just start swinging. When you have limited resources, you have to be smart. And that's where good leadership comes in: being receptive to new ideas and new ways to do business, allocating limited resources effectively and moving quickly to maximize on delivery. That's all pretty basic strategy stuff of course, fine. But getting to that point takes something else. Courage and inspiration. Courage to follow your note and inspiration to get others to follow your lead. Change does not come easily to groups, and you have to make sure everyone is on the same page. All this is to say - that's what we're doing right now. We recognize that while rVibe is pretty well differentiated in terms functions, look/feel, benefits; we need to also differentiate further to be really successful. Thus, we're adding a segment to our business. We were approached with an opportunity, we maximized that relationship, we extended it and started developing additional partners and we're moving. We'll be able to announce more about our direction pretty soon - but suffice it to say - it's both a new business that very very few others are doing - and no body like where we're headed, as well a great fit into the rVibe ecosystem for music delivery.
