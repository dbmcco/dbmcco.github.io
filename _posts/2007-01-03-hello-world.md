It's about time I started a blog - so here it is. My intent is to discuss some of the things that interest me most and chronicle starting [rvibe](http://www.rvibe.com "rVibe"). I have really missed the boat on the chronicle part - since I started rvibe in 2004, but better late than never I suppose. As for the interesting part... Generally that's all things new (not rehashed), the power of aggregation, a wide variety of music and books, and the social world that underpins everything.
