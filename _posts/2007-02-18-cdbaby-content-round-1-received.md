We've taken delivery of our first set of content from CDBaby - around 1 terabyte of data. Not bad; we have about 14 more to go. We took it in FLAC format so we could massage the conversion to our liking - since we're offering a higher encoding rate than other services (no skin off our p2p based teeth = no cost to us). The initial coversion should take about 2 days and reduce the size to about 750GB. Then we're going to store everything on Amazon S3 (back up and seed files (should we need them)). We have a pretty fast line, but I am sure that upload is going to take a week.
