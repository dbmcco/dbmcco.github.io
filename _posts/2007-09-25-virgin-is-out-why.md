Well - [Virgin Digital is done selling music online](http://news.digitaltrends.com/news/story/14266/virgin_digital_exits_music_business). They have transferred all their customer stuff to Napster. When a customer focused, value add focused, cash flush company exits a market so quickly and quietly, it makes you wonder why. There are not that many reasons: 

  1. **It was hemorrhaging money:** But I think not enough of a reason in this case.
  2. **Outside core value offering:** Definitely think this is a good reason for Virgin Digital to exit this market.
  3. **Outside company strategy:** Reasonable, but not for such a quick exit.
  4. **New strategy in place:** And not compatible with existing strategy. Very reasonable - and I think the most likely.
  5. **Exec hated and killed it:** It happens, and could be related to any of the above.

So - if I am right about number 4 - that Virgin has a new strategy in place that is not compatible with the existing service, then what could that service be? Here's what I could imagine: **Virgin Mobile music download service.** A la carte downloads directly to your phone. Much like Verizon vCast. The open question there is: Would this be enough to draw new users to their service, or do will they need and do further differentiation? We'll see. I give it 6-9 months before they roll out a new service under a different corporate banner.
