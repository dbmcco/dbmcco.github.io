There are many many moments when building rVibe is challenging (at best). The notion of a roller coaster is way off base - unless roller coasters go up to the moon and back. But everyday I am thankful that I have the opportunity to work this project and make it what it is. And I particularly appreciate our partners and users who make us what we are. And I am super excited about our next two releases. In the Beta 1 release we nailed the core eCommerce functionality and social networking functionality. In the next two we do a lot of clean up, performance enhancement and add a bunch of really cool stuff that I am super excited about: 

  1. Original Content Registration for independent artists
  2. Commenting on all things (people, playlists, artists, albums and tracks)
  3. Tag and Genre browsing (I really like this one and it's different than anything else I've seen so far out there)
  4. Charitable donations
  5. Click through email delivery for viral growth (yes, that's cryptic, but I don't want to say more yet)

So - we're testing against the development environment now. I am sure there are a host of issues that will come up, but it's really flying forward now. Interim Beta 1b release set for Wednesday 15th. Yahoo!
