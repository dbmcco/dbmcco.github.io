		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In late 2005 we did our first<em>pro forma </em>financials.  Our accountants, <a href="http://www.isdanerllc.com/home.html" title="Isdaner">Isdaner and Co</a> (namely <a href="http://www.isdanerllc.com/abrams.html" title="Hank Abrams">Hank Abrams</a>) did a great job of pulling together what was a messy set of materials into a meaningful whole.

Unfortunately, our core assumptions were wrong. We made the classic top-down, young exuberant company market size goof. Meaning, we picked a market size and amount we wanted to capture. We said that the total p2p swapping volume is around 32 billion files swapped per year, and if we can convert 0.75% of that into revenue at $0.99 per swap, then - wow - we're making a whole lot of money!  

Of course, that's a bogus way to calculate market size, and we've since done a bottom up analysis. We took a look at our demographic in terms of accessible numbers, did a little primary market research to gauge interest (pretty high, btw)  and determined total probabal user population. We factored a relatively even growth curve, assumed some <a href="http://www.akamai.com/html/about/press/releases/2006/press_121106.html" title="Akamai market data">sales averages</a> and derived our <em>pro formas</em> that way.  Until you have real revenue, knowing your customers is the only way to forecast revenue.

Lesson learned.]]></content:encoded>

The interpretations are really solid and when <a href="http://www.jonathabrooke.com/" title="Jonatha Brooke">Jonatha Brooke</a> takes a turn at the Simon &amp; Garfunkle's title track, she gives it a soulful and yet gentle touch.  

I've appreciated Jonatha's touch for a while now. She has a delicate, breathy tone but manages to sound full at the same time. Her voice also has that magical quality of blending well with other voices. A very nice straight tone that can also have some bite to it.  And on "Bleecker Street" the simple arrangement of guitars is a perfect compliment to her grounded and unaffected sound.

And the engineering is superb.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[That's the general thinking in consumer products.  It's true, but sometimes it's hard to know what people want.  And asking doesn't always mean much. There are some flaws in believing that the consumer knows what they want - like "why would I need a portable music player when my hi-fi works fine the way it is?"  yup.

And, the consumer mindset is different than government or pharma - where those organizations might "need" something, and not think of it as want. And in <a href="http://www.rvibe.com" title="rVibe">rVibe</a>'s case, where it's a competitive environment and we're delivering the same end product as everyone else (on-line music), the question is a little different than just providing something people want.

Clearly there is a desire to buy music on-line - <a href="http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_resources/digital-music-report.html" title="IFPI Stats">189% market growth</a> last year, and something like 150% this year (whether you agree with those numbers or not doesn't matter, the growth is large in any case). So - how do you access that desire - how do you drive consumers to your way of selling them that product? 

An analogy from the physical world is hardware stores across the street from one another. Both sell hammers and nails, so how do they compete? How do they <em>differentiate? </em>To draw in traffic, the customer has to recognize you, trust you and you have to add value to the consumer, make them come back only to you and get them to have their friends come to you.

It's more than just giving what people want - you have to identify with them and add value. They can already get what they want easily, you have to do more. That means branding and functionality. The brand has to be clear and resonate with your target market and your functions have to add value.

We've worked hard to differentiate our brand and functionality so that it's clear where we're different and we add value. And our market research shows that our brand and functionality resonates with our user population. That seems to be a recipe for success.

We'll see.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am just finishing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060655186?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rvibe07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0060655186">Who Wrote the New Testament?: The Making of the Christian Myth</a><img border="0" width="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rvibe07-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0060655186" height="1" style="border:medium none;margin:0;" />, by <a href="http://www.as.ua.edu/rel/aboutrelbiomack.html">Burton Mack</a>. For the uninitiated (that's me) in the early history of Christianity, this book is pretty revealing/apple-cart-spilling. Mack's whole proposal is that the books and letters of the Christian Bible were written by specific "Jesus" and "Christ" communities who had specific goals in mind when they wrote them (like to justify Jesus as a Hellenistic type teacher aimed at dismantling the exclusivity of Judaism, or to craft a mythical figure destined to inherit the crown of the Israel epic, or to tie later 'bishops' back to Jesus via mythical apostles ).  He calls out a lot of the disconnected myths embedded in early Christian theology and destroys the idea that the current Bible is anything more than attempt to pull together disparate Jesus/Christ communities into a unified whole. Not easy to read, but a <em>tour de force</em>  none-the-less. If you are a staunch believer that the Bible is the word of God, you're going to pretty challenged by this one. I rather like his take on things.

The one <em>major</em>  criticism I have is that in general he is <em>very </em>sparse on citations and strong evidence, instead relying almost wholly on his knowledge. Although the argument is very well done, I am left wanting for more proof; it's not enough to simply say that it is - you have to demonstrate it.

That said, most interesting is that the creation of the Bible as he describes it is the polar opposite of how we currently understand it. When we think of the Bible today, it's as though it magically came into being and was written end-to-end and published.  However, that's far far from the case - it was "developed" over a couple centuries and was <em>aggregated</em>to unify a socio-religious movement that was becoming much too fragmented. 

Recasting the Bible in a new light with a well thought out premise may be enough on it's own to warrant merit. At the minimum, worthwhile lesson in the creation of any grouping of people.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Means of Production typically refers to anything "workers" use to make products. Historically and Sociologically that includes tools, materials, money and other products. It doesn't mean the people themselves (that's one of the "Factors of Production"), or Land. It typically has a negative connotation and is associated with Marx's concept of exploitation of the working class.

But as both an owner of the MoP and a Factor of Production my self, I would consider it a little differently. I believe one of the means of production to be the aggregation of apparently disparate things. In the computing model this would be something like CPU sharing (ie: Folding at home), but it can be anything - Social Networks as intelligent systems (like Collaborative Filtering), or Distributed electricity production to create a virtual grid. In this case, worker also become systems focused on a single (or multi-facet, single), goal.

In this model, by leveraging the aggregate of things as a means of production, I believe we can foster dramatically increased efficiency in production as well as decreased waste of resources and capital.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There is so much talk in the digital music space of subscription versus download versus streaming, all considered through the lense of DRM, iPods + iTunes sales (or lack thereof) and the overall music market, that it's enough to make one forget we're talking about music. So, I thought I'd spin out some thoughts on what all of this music stuff really means and why we as consumers, entprenuers, investors and everyone else make so much of it and have such a hard time understanding it all.  It's a bunch of material, so it's going to cover a few entries.

Let's start with the basics: what is music? It's a funny question that a lot of people have attemped to answer over the years. There is the mechanical part to it: metre &amp; rhythm, timbre, pitch and silence. There is flowery part to it: "they sky opened up and a new meoldy like a ray of light shown through."  There is the experiential part to it: "It just speaks to my soul..." and there is the theoretical part to it: "By shifting the background harmonic progression from one key area to another over the exposition, there is a general delay in resolution through the recapitulation. This sense of delay is offset by the faster paced middle ground during the development and the ornamental foreground that makes up the primary meolody." All ways to talk about what is music.

And they do answer the question: what is music?  Kind of. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_cage">John Cage</a> broke it open with his piece 4:33 - where the pianist simply sits at the piano for 4:33 seconds (the funny part is that it's actually made up of 3 parts). The audience noise over the 4:33 is the music. Sure - why not. What is music? Is it noise? Is it silence? Is it the traffic on the street or the sound of a tree falling in the woods? Is it the voice of God?

I would sugget that the question is really immiterial. Music is what we make of it. And by we, I mean humans. Music is not what whales do - unless we interpret it as music. Traffic is not music - unless we interpret it. And people generally do not interpret it that way. However - music as a collection of intentionally organized sounds by humans to cause an affect in a human listener is generally considered music. And note the important thing here:  "intentionally...affect ... a listener" It's all about human interaction.

Music is at its foundation a social experience. It is the experience of one human making a sound (that sound commonnly understood as music) for another person to hear. Or many people making that sound for many people. But it is always about people using intentionally organized sound to be heard by other people. Understanding music as a social experience has a profound impact on how we understand the structures of composer/performer/audience/audience interaction. And it has profound implications for what recordings mean to music.

In olden days when there was no recorded music (for example, Vienna 1789, Mozart), people would go to concerts to listen to music. They would pay money for a ticket, or buy a subscription to a sieries of concerts (organized by date, or composer, or group).  They would go, listen, socialize (often during listening) and leave. But imagine the scene - groups of people sitting around listening to groups of people make music.  Of course that is not much different than live performances today - even arena concerts.

That is the social experience part. Think of this: when you've heard the last song of piece in a concert where you thought the music was excellent, the performance was outstanding and there was tremendous energy in the audience. When that song ore piece ended, and immediately before the applause starts there is a moment when everyone is acutely aware of having shared the same experience with almost the same set of feelings. That is the social experinece part - and that is the fundamental nature of music.

Ok - so that's music. In our day and age where we have recorded music, it's still that, just slightly abstracted. But that may make the concert experinece that much more important, I am not sure. But there is something important here about music experience and what people do to access the musical experience.

In general, I believe there is a spectrum of listeners - and filtered through the lense of the social experinece they look like this:  Those who actively seek the social experience of music, and those who just don't feel strongly about it. As an example, think of people who never go to a concert, and only listen to music on the car radio. Those folks fall the the far right in my scheme. Then there are those who actively go to concerts and participate in "the scene" - they fall to the far left in my scheme.

And music scenes are an interesting way to think about this.  Open mic night, or indie bands with a loyal following (think Bearnaked Ladies in the early days) are a good example. Where people congregate, they sometimes see people they know, but even if they don't they are joining a social network with weak ties based on an affilitation with a musical experience.  Those ties can be stronger or weaker, but they ties are real.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At its core, music is a social and shared experience. That is just simply its nature. Thus, it seems reasonable that certain behaviors that people exhibit around music would translate well into a technoloy solution/platform.  Here are some of those behaviors:
<ol>
	<li>Congregation related to a specific music style, artist or even song (concerts)</li>
	<li>Payment for experiencing those events (unless they are free like a benefit concert)</li>
	<li>Group enjoyment of the event (there is nothing like knowing you just experienced the same thing as another person) </li>
	<li>Discussion of the event</li>
</ol>
Listening

Performance

Writing

Recording (transferring the listening experience in time and place). Making the listening experience less of a shared experience (leading to stealing).  Maybe social experience of music can defeat piracy]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yes we have a mobile strategy. No it's not ready, but we have a roadmap to get there. And ok - now I am officially obsessed with a differentiated mobile strategy.<span>  </span>And thinking about the Nokia lauch, I think that other carriers would be obsessed too.<span>  </span>

That said, I had been content with a fairly lightweight version of rVibe on a phone. But here is what I am thinking (and yes, we can do this, yes the platform supports it and yes, we could do it in 6 months with the right support and $).
<ol>
	<li>Desktop client as is, but with added support for managing your (Virgin) phone:<span>  </span>songs, content, preferences, account preferences, what ever.</li>
	<li>Web browser client to handle your account when you're away from your desktop</li>
	<li>Mobile client that is installed on the phone that allows for the following:<span> </span>
<ol>
	<li>Social networking based on your rVibe users and your contact list (or a subset of your contact list)<span> </span></li>
	<li><span></span>Music streaming of the music you own (from your computer)<span> </span></li>
	<li>Sending/receiving recommendations for tunes to your friends<span> </span></li>
	<li><span></span>Auditioning these tunes and replying</li>
	<li>Browsing of tunes based on tags</li>
	<li>Purchasing tunes. </li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Option 1: auto download to desktop (from server or p2p cloud) and stream to phone<span> </span></li>
	<li><span></span>option 2: stream to phone/download to phone from server/p2p cloudI think that would be waaaay cool.<span>   </span>So - even if there is no mobile carrier in our future, once we have additional $ in hand, we're going to build it anyway and allow users to install on unlocked phones.</li>
</ol>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I got an email from <a href="http://www.nep.benfranklin.org/">Ben Franklin</a> saying "hey - the most current Exec Summary we have is from November, can you send the most current one? We'd like to put you in front of a new fund that is opening."  I spend the next hour updating the Exec and sent it right over - move fast or the chance is gone!  I can't even remember how many times I have done exactly that. Too many to count, that's for sure. 

Ben Franklin has been very good to us, both as an investor and as an adviser and they continue to put us in front of folks (<a href="http://www.newyorkangels.com/" title="NY Angels">NY Angels</a>, <a href="http://www.privateinvestorsforum.com/">PIF</a>, <a href="http://www.fundingpost.com/venturefund/venture-fund-profile.asp?fund=217">LORE</a>). They are now putting us in front of another.

We've been around the funding block a few times now.  And I don't mean big institutional funding, I mean the small, "friends family fools", angels and small institutional VC block.  It's not a big block and it's very hard to find the doors to the buildings.  We have gotten over $200k, but that's not a lot for starting a business.

Our market environment is very scary for investors - big, growing, lots of deep-pocketed competition and no apparent differentiation (we disagree). Of course, the same could have been said for YouTube.  I am confident that soon there will be an investor who gets it.

Fingers Crossed.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This past summer I connected with a local owner who, for the last 15 years or so, has run a mildly successful website for musicians.  It had been much more robust and was bought out in the '90s, but he bought it back when the new owners ran it into the ground.

We met for lunch near King of Prussia with one of our advisers to meet and greet and explore possibilities. <a href="http://www.bahamabreeze.com/">Bahama Breeze</a> is as good a place as any, I suppose.  We sat down in a booth, I had dressed a bit for the meeting, as had our adviser and the person we were meeting wore shorts, flip-flops and a black t shirt. And somehow that wasn't in appropriate - a trick I have yet to learn. We ordered. I was going to have a lunch salad, but when everyone else ordered burgers, so did I.

NDA's were passed around and he floated out his idea for a merger between <a href="http://www.rvibe.com">rVibe</a> and his company. He wanted to launch a new b2b music service, and merge it with our b2c service. The meeting went very well, everyone wanted to move forward and have further discussions (which is always my take on anything) and see where this would go.

When I got back, I checked out the revenue <em>pro formas</em>- straight double digit growth starting out the gate. It gave me both a red flag and the heebeegeebees - I had done a similar thing months previously, but had learned my lesson. Not everyone does, I guess.

A few email exchanges later, I found out he wanted to do a pink-sheet IPO where we merged with the one company and another he owns that is already public.  I backed off - the possibility of liquidity past that point would have been a nightmare and no investor would have gone near it.

I will always explore a partnership, but am very cautious about signing a deal.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With all the hype around tagging things - everything, you would think it would have hit email by now. I can't tell you how often I dig through email to find something that I know is in there and if I could only sort it by topic I could find it easily.... yup - if I could just tag it.  

Yes, you can sort with folders - kind of. But I want to be able to do multiple tags per email so I can find stuff with Boolean searches. And email often has multiple topics associated with it.

And wow - if you could do that at the enterprise level and get access to centralized email - that would be incredibly powerful for knowledge sharing and re-use. As long as there were measures to protect email privacy (ie: mark this private).

Not sure how you would monetize it - expect for add-on software sales, but I would love to have that.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="left" width="107" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/surfacing.thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Surfacing" height="106" style="width:107px;height:106px;" />In my current playlist (among other things) is Sarah McLachlan's <em>Angel</em> from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002VT6?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rvibe07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000002VT6">Surfacing</a>. On <em>Angel</em> she hits it perfectly.  The rich mix of piano and cello sets a nice spartan atmosphere for her breathy-then-full-again voice to glide over. While a bit on the repetitive side, that's part of the grace of it. You can become immersed in it easily.
<p align="left">Her engineers have also mastered the use of reverb for her style. Super wet, but still transparent. If you listen in headphones, the trails last forever giving an additional other-worldly sense, which enhances the immersion experience.</p>
I'm not keen on the rest of the album, although there are a couple decent tunes, but this one has some sticking power.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In consumer software, we've found that it's critical the User Interface (UI) aligns with your core demographic's expectations. And to build a UI that does that successfully, we've also found you need to have a solid cultural reference and operation from a set of assumptions that align with your population. There are strong implications for function, color, space and language that are extremely important.  That points to using US based technical development staff - either employees or consultants.

We tried using offshore resources for UI based development in the past, and frankly it was a disaster. It's not that the offshore team didn't deliver a high quality product, it's just that the UI didn't resonate from a US user standpoint. So, you bite the bullet and use onshore, despite the dramatic cost difference (4-5x).

You can however, use offshore for backend functionality successfully.  In VC terms that means we've been "capital efficient", but from where I sit, it just means we can our software done. I was told once that for a software company to outsource its soul is wrong.  To some extent I agree, but I think you have to do what it takes to get it done, otherwise the soul withers and carries no value.  I would also suggest that as coding begins to hit commodity status, it's possible to get what you need and want if you know your business and technology well.

However you feel, for us right now it's all about the appropriate application of capital at the most minute level.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.nep.benfranklin.org/">Ben Franklin Technology Partners</a> has supported us from the beginning when we presented in 2004 and the accepted us into their portfolio.  Last year they invested $50,000 in us. We have another opportunity now for an additional round with them.

Since they are a government backed VC, they have a strict application process that governs their rounds. We'll submit the next one on Feb 5, it will get reviewed by outside sources, we'll present to the portfolio board on March 5 and go before the Board shortly thereafter.  Unless we get hung up somewhere along the way. That's possible, but we're working closely with them and they really want to see us succeed. The round is going to hinge on our launch of <a href="http://www.rvibe.com">rVibe</a>.

In fact, that has pretty much been the message we've gotten all along - this is a tricky market and you are unproven as an entrepreneur team - get your product done and we'll talk then.  Chicken and Egg.

Now we're in range and it will be interesting to see. I've spoken to a couple <a href="http://www.focusenterprises.com/">M&amp;A</a> firms who believe strongly that when we launch we will be approached for investment as well as acquisition. We'll see. ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We feel pretty strongly that social networks are the key to a successful music service (if you're not selling MP3 players that is). The store front model just doesn't cut it for content discovery and the social networks in which we live (both real and virtual) play a key role on our consumer activity.
<p align="left"><img align="left" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/lastfm.thumbnail.gif" alt="Last.fm" />So, it's not without trepidation that we're starting to see more and more social network<em>ing</em> based music services.  There are many now - Last.fm, MOG, Goombah and others. Fortunately, most have not really leveraged "social network" so much as just being a place for social networking (for a description of the difference, take a look through Danah Boyd's great blog) around music.</p>
We're taking a different approach - your social network is the key to accessing new music. Not just networking around music, but the activity within that defined network is what is going to drive an increase in sales.  Not the passive browsing of Last.Fm or the tagging of MOG (again, passive); although we have both of those as well.  I am talking the influence of the social network, the linking between networks and getting traffic to jump between networks. 

In our case, we've incentivized the activity, and that is critical. But you have to also provide the tools to easily move between groups and identify other networks in which you want to participate. Once you do that, you can begin to analyze network data and leverage to facilitate user activity.

In essence, while Social Networking is the new direction, Social Networks (and the data they create) are the killer application.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Everyone is <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;q=zune">talking about Microsoft's Zune</a>. Speculation abounds on how well it will or won't do, if it will eclipse the iPod or fizzle completely. Analysis supporting success and failure focus mostly on the Zune's own eco-system of player+store, the wireless addition (limited as it is) for social music sharing and the strict DRM components.

From where I sit, there is a piece that is strangely missing from the discussion.  If the banner ads floating around Manhattan are any example, Microsoft can't really decide what Zune is - but and they really don't have it pegged as a social device. It's cool, it's fun, it's got lots of beautiful people playfully using it.... Sounds like an [substitute MP3 player of choice] to me.

The problem with Zune, and the reason v1.0 will only see moderate success is that it doesn't add significant differentiated value via social networks and where there is the ability to leverage social networks, that ability is dramatically hobbled.

Here's what would make it work:  1. Let me build a list of friends on my Zune and the accompanying software; 2. Let my friends send me music (over the air or wire) and do it without restriction (even between other music systems);  3. Let me use the Zune to then send tracks back (again, over the air or wire);  4. Let me browse my friend's music, or browse their friends on my Zune and 5. download tracks on the fly.

Let me use it to build a social network within the system and leverage it for new music discovery.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here in the US, Henryk Gorecki gets a bit short-changed as a composer of self-reflective trance-like symphony and choral pieces.  On the one hand, it's well deserved - Symphony No. 3 and Totus Tuus both easily fall into that category. However, it's not fully deserved, he has written a lot of other music that definitely does NOT fall into that category.

Also, I like to think of it a bit differently. Since high-school I have loved Russian choral music. Now, this is not Russian, it's Polish and make no mistake there is a difference.  For one, Polish music is far more understated and less overtly dramatic than Russian music. For another, it's got a stronger Western European influence built in so it doesn't have as much of an "ethnic" flare to it (to Western ears anyway).  However, they really do tie together and for what I am about to say, it goes for Russian and Polish music in general (as a gross over generalization).

The Russian and Polish choral traditions are completely wonderful things. The purity of tone and simplicity of voicing as well as character of the choirs themselves far and away are better than English, German, French or American choral music of choirs. The traditional choral music from both countries is delightful and moving at the same time.

The Prague Philharmonic Choir performs <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000012UB?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rvibe07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0000012UB">Totus Tuus, Op. 60</a> <img border="0" width="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rvibe07-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0000012UB" height="1" style="border:medium none;margin:0;" />in an marvelously gorgeous way. While the Prague Philharmonic is Checz, they still clearly grasp the Eastern Euopean choral tradition. This performance is not trance-like music - it is musical interpretation of the highest calibre. The natural phrasing and beautifully blended choir make a complex presentation of otherwise simple music.  The straight tones of the group combine to offer a sense of intensity that I think choirs of the English tradition lack. ]]></content:encoded>

		<title><![CDATA[The "majors" (record labels)]]></title>
		<link>https://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/2007/01/09/the-majors-record-labels/</link>
		<pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2007 16:47:34 +0000</pubDate>

		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/2007/01/09/the-majors-record-labels/</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[People decry the major record labels (Universal, Sony/BMG, Warner and EMI - in that order of size) as evil, killers of freedom, backward, idiotic, and stifling. They bemoan the by-gone days of a label nurturing an artist through their career into an artist of meaning.  They classify them as controlling (ie: requiring DRM), or underhanded (ie: Sony root-kits DRM), or just plain terrible.

I completely disagree. In my view, they are neither good, nor bad, they simply are companies operating under a business model in a market economy.  Their model may not be optimized to take full advantage of market forces, but they are operating relatively soundly from a business standpoint (at least a business that is in a position to tolerate losses).

A good way to think about the labels is as Venture Capital firms; where they provide capital, guidance and networking to entrepreneurs (in this case, artists).  In the past (like the 1950's-1970's) the labels operated as seed and early stage funds, selecting artists they believed in, then used their capital and funds to grow them. Now however, they operate more as mezzanine funds where they take artists who have established them selves (to some degree), add additional capital, bring in additional executive support (ie: mega-producers), money for marketing/distribution and thereby drive up the value and increase sales.

As such, they perform a valuable service by fostering the growth of viable talent.  They have enhanced their portfolio by offloading risk onto smaller labels and/or the artist themselves and focused their use of capital on moving those acts forward.  They also subscribe to the 80/20 rule (although I am not sure of exact numbers on that) on returns, as would a VC.

However, here is where the analogy departs ways. What is missing out of the labels is a willingness to overhaul operating models to align more fully with an active and growing market.  If a VC were to operate as the labels do, they would quickly reduce the value they provide and their returns would fall (which is what is happening to the labels now) and they would never raise another fund.

So, to bring the labels back to a reasonable space, they would need to overhaul their models for distribution. They do creation, brand identity and sales just fine, but they are missing valuable, underused channels for distribution. And without distribution, there is no sale. 

While that change seems to be starting, it's very slow - and it's not because labels are money grubbing evil places or they are idiots, or don't see the writing on the wall.  The culture of the label is driven a command and control hierarchy, one where there is a start at the bottom and work your way up mentality; and outsiders are not welcome. It's a traditional American corporate structure with control at the top and not much in the way of empowerment (except at the producer and A&amp;R levels).  This mindset of control permeates all levels of change in these organizations.

That type of entrenched culture of makes it difficult to enact change in any sweeping way. And since the majors own the vast majority of performance rights, and the current environment is not open to new distribution, it makes it tricky to open any new distribution channels with out them.

If the majors want to take advantage of new market opportunities, they are going to have to enable change in their organizations. To do that will require executives who have deep experience in driving cultural change through an organization.   And I believe those executives will only be hired when the losses become so great that the labels can no longer sustain current models (which they still can at the moment).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We've gone through a number of investor presentations now, filled out lots of forms and gotten lots of questions. I am not a spectacular fundraiser, but have now been around the block a least a little bit (albeit a rather small block).

And as I have talked to Angel investors and institutional investors, I always get the same question (although not from Friends and Family, interestingly). And I have come to both understand, loathe and now love that question:  "What is your exit strategy?"

At first it always seemed to be a question of 'have you thought this through?' or 'how are you going to turn this thing into a billion dollars for me?' or 'does this mean you have figured out how to out Google, Google?'  But then I came to realize (with no small amount of prodding), that they are really asking something else. They are really asking about themselves. What they are really asking is this:  "When are you going to provide me a liquidity event?"  Meaning - "when am I going to get some return on my investment?"

For an Angel investor, this liquidity event could be from follow on Institutional funding. Likewise for an early stage VC. For later stage VC's, it more around who is going to acquire you (there is no illusion around IPO's today - and particularly for our space).

And here is why I love this question:  It reveals the truth - it's all about money. For the entrepreneur, it's all about what they are building, and the passion - but that's not the case for an investor, it's all about return on investment.

Since I've come to realize that, the answer is so much easier:  We expect multiple liquidity events planned over three investment rounds - for your easy exit at your comfortable return; culminating in an acquisition between years 3-5. And we're working hard to minimize your risk and reduce your exposure through actioning multiple investment channels.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the rVibe service, there is a strong data and data-mining component, around the music, the people who are buying/using music and the intersection of people and music.  Clearly, data around who is using/buying what/how/from whom has pretty major implications for a variety of things (marketing, recommendations, metrics, viral patterning, technology, privacy, customer experience, etc) and rVibe is not the only service where this is important; there are lots of companies attempting to leverage that for a variety of reasons (ie: Mog, Last.fm, Goombah and others). Data and data relationships also have implications for monetizing music downloads.

However there are significant challenges in the many-to-many relationships inherent in the music service space, and in the consistently of data within each data type (music, aggregates (playlists, albums, tag lists) and people and their lists). And this becomes particularly complicated around the social-networking and music and commerce. 

What a system has to contend with is inconsistent data coming from many sources with multiple references to the data and multiple uses. For instance, what happens when someone browses my collection (data I generated), makes a recommendation to a third person for a track they have, that I also have (data they generated) that person then wants to purchase and download? And do that such that the person gets the right file, legally and the content owner gets remunerated (and in our case the referrer and I both receive rewards)?

If you're not careful and build in a robust data management process from the begining, the result is in a messy and inaccurate consumer experience. Hence why most companies shy away from a many to many model for music distribution and social networking from a commerce standpoint (rVibe model).  It's much easier to simply display available content with gold data and permit purchase and download (iTunes model).

Last.fm or Goombah, as social networking based music services might eventually offer a way to purchase music from user generated data (not content), but they could only do so from a centralized source (ie: backend server environment) without significant development.  They also would have difficulty with any content not from a major content provider (read: user generated content).  And that's just from a technical standpoint, let alone from  branding standpoint. Snocap is working on acting as that central clearing house, but you still have data issues in the social networking standpoint and the need for a retail front end.

In order to make it work, you have to build your data structures from the beginning with the intent of capturing the many-to-many relationships between people-to-music-to-people-to-music with commerce rules, built in to the content controls (and identification). It's not just enough to track the relationships, you have to identify the business rules.   You also have to have a degree of trust in the meta-data for the music you want to monetize. 

So - it's one thing to say "Braydon is listening to Bleecker Street by Jonatha Brooke", it's another to say "Braydon is listening to Bleecker Street by Jonatha Brooke, click here to download it (from him and his friends)." And that captures one of multi-layered technical barriers to entry in creating a social-networking based music service (data, permissions, transport, performance, education).

But we're almost there, so I am pretty excited about it. And it's great to be at the forefront of the shift from the <em>store-front-model for sales</em> to the <em>network-model for sales</em>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p align="left"><img align="left" width="76" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/appalachian-spring.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Orpheus Chamber Orchestra - Appalachian Spring" height="77" style="width:76px;height:77px;" />For a guy from Brooklyn, Aaron Copland sure could write music that evokes Americana country. The orchestra version of Appalachian spring is one of those iconic American pieces of music that's had a deep influence on music in this country since it's debut, and has permeated our collective conscious. Think of "gift to be simple" and his variations at the end of Appalachian Spring come to mind.</p>
That said, I really prefer the original orchestration for 13 instruments.  It was intended as a ballet score that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Graham">Martha Graham</a>commissioned and the tone and character really befit the smaller ensemble (similarly to Barber's Adagio for Strings is better in the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000E6P6?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rvibe07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00000E6P6">string quartet version</a><img border="0" width="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rvibe07-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00000E6P6" height="1" style="border:medium none;margin:0;" />).

Copland is one of the American composers who was deeply influenced by French orchestration and structural techniques (although the structure doesn't show up so much in his programmatic works like this one) and Appalachian Spring is no exception.  If you're looking for an instructional kit for how to write for winds, just listen to the first section of Appalachian Spring. 

I always get a little hung up on how fragmented the piece feels, but that goes with the territory (ballet). And I am happy to overlook that when we hit the coda after the variations. Talk about a way to unwind energy from a piece of music.

The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000009I79?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rvibe07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000009I79">Orpheus Chamber Orchestra's version</a><img border="0" width="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rvibe07-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000009I79" height="1" style="border:medium none;margin:0;" /> is really wonderful. While it's a little more than 13 instruments, they really captures the feel of the original score and have a vibrance and intensity missing from larger groups.  Their accuracy and tone are also incredible as well as their blending. In this recording, the engineering is excellent; the sound stage is present without being overbearing and the balance is remarkable. However, it is very detailed, so if you don't like the occasional click of keys, it might not be for you.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p align="left"><img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/emilogo.thumbnail.gif" alt="EMI" />EMI has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&amp;sid=apQMFunkA2Yo&amp;refer=europe">shaken up its senior management and ousted</a> a couple long standing significant players. With music revenue down an additional 10%, shares down 26% and digital music only accounting for 8.5% of total sales, the picture is bleak for EMI right now. Hence the change in management. </p>
However, it was just a change, not actually bringing in new blood; instead just <a href="http://www.musicsoundfoundation.com/biog_ericnicoli.html">shifting responsibility</a> around.  One would think that when market bells toll to such a worrisome extend that there would be more dramatic changes, but maybe there is more to come.

I <a href="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/2007/01/09/the-majors-record-labels/">highlighted earlier</a> that there needs to be a change, in management, in culture and willingness to change distribution tactics in the Majors for them to realize the potential revenue from on-line sales. This could be the opportune time to jump in to the Major space.

We reengaged EMI last week and are in the process of re-starting our license negotiations with them. Our take on it - allow us a license for anything you can in an open MP3 format from your current digital catalog and as much as possible from your back-catalog. If you can't do everything, that is ok, we'll take what you can give us now.

We'll see what happens in the next couple weeks, it might be the right time for EMI to implement some distribution changes, if we hand them an elegent want to action it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/cplus.gif" title="cpluslogo"><img align="right" width="104" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/cplus.thumbnail.gif" alt="cpluslogo" height="94" style="width:104px;height:94px;" /></a>When building client side software that interfaces directly with the internet (as we are), it's very tempting to write in Java. You get the nice benefit of a cross-platform runtime where you can pretty much drop in code and you're ready to go.  It's got great firewall tunnelling support and it's easy and fast to develop.   Unfortunately performance is very slow, the memory footprint is large, it requires additional client side installs and when you want to move outside there runtime environment it gets ugly. And when using it, it feel - well, like Java, which isn't so great.

<a href="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/java.jpg" title="javalogo"><img align="left" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/java.thumbnail.jpg" alt="javalogo" /></a>So we look to C++ as a language. The performance is excellent, the code environment is solid and there are lots of classes available for it, making it easy to get up and running quickly. The developers are typically more expensive and you actually have to port the code to other platforms, but what you gain is more stability and faster performance.  So we choose C++ as our language of choice since performance (or at least the perception of performance) is crucial to our application.

Now you run into other concerns.  How do you access the CD Burner, or the Audio Player or the Networking stack?  You have to write these classes, or use ones in existence.  In Microsoft, that means using MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes), which are easy to "wrap" into your code and use them. But that gets tricky, because if you don't write them yourself, you're then tied into the Microsoft platform for lots of your core functionality.  I suppose that's not all bad, but we really want to have an Apple client, not just a Microsoft.

However, in the interest of time, we're wrapping MFCs with C++ code. We're deal with port and any class rewrites later.

Wow - you gotta love technology speak, check out that sentence - LOL!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Napster has a new <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070114-8610.html">partner agreement</a> in place with AOL to help build revenue. The two companies signed a deal where Napster will take over AOL Music's (previously a MusicNet company) subscriber base. Add to the mix that Napster put it self on the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060919-7779.html">auction block recently</a> and this has very interesting implications for the new relationship.

Now, common thinking in online music is that subscription services are better than a la cart. Meaning, they tend to have a higher profit margin - implying a lower cost of goods on a per track sales basis.  Margins piece might be right, but I am not so sure it's really makes sense - since this is a business of high-volume, very low per sale margin, I believe that thinking is suspect.

Consider this: AOL's music service hasn't been doing great, and neither has Napster's. Napster has a subscription model, AOL is moving away from subscriptionto an ad supported model. Everything makes sense so far.  In AOL's view, remove a business unit that is costly and not aligned with the new ad model. In Napster's view, add subscribers to increase revenue and volume.

But in essence, you have two businesses with floundering revenue models and revenue seeking new ways to acquire business who have decided to partner to add value. Of course, that's what the thinking often is in a M&amp;A as well.

Once AOL off loads its Music business onto Napster they now have room to do one of two things:  1. develop an ad supported music distribution model on their own 2. develop same, incorporate it into Napster and buy Napster. 

Strategic partners are most often the best acquisition partners. I am betting we start to see a shift in the Napster model that begins to align with AOL's new model.  One such scenario is that in lieu of a subscription fee that gets divvied up for the content owners, users get free music and AOL does a revenue share on advertising dollars (almost like a media tax) based on usage. Just don't tell SpiralFrog though, they would probably have wanted that deal. Of course, they could get snatched up as a means to that end. 

But since <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/new-akamai-index-measures-real-time/story.aspx?guid=%7BA4130F78-298C-4168-8AC5-DA43B62F5D37%7D&amp;sid=157330&amp;symb=">82% of consumers prefer a la carte</a>, none of it might work.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I read Fred Wilson's blog pretty regularly (it's a great blog) and he has some very interesting insights.  He <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2007/01/david_kirkpatri.html">just posted</a> about the future of digital music and it sparked a bit of hot debate on his blog.  In a nutshell, he's saying that the future of digital music is not in pay-per-download (ie: iTunes), that model is outdated now, but that the future are Rhapsody (rental/streaming + Hardware based devices) type services.

I realize that as a VC, his job is to spot trends/companies and use VC capital/expertise to take advantage of large opportunities; through that lens, maybe his view makes some sense. Meaning, if he believes that the rental/streaming model is capital efficient, has a high margin, and is underused in the marketplace while starting to make in roads; and in 5 years will be significantly larger, then he is right (although I don't know about the capital efficient or margin part), there is a great future for that kind of thing.

However, it bothers me whenever I hear anyone of any perspective say there is a single answer to the future of anything. And when you have a market as large and growing as digital music, it kind of seems wrong to prognosticate about a service type as the future. 

An analogy looking back: the car is the way of the future.  It will be the way people transport themselves and things they have from place to place.  Trains, planes, motorcycles, buses, trucks, bicycles and walking are out-dated. Never mind that space elevators are on the horizon. There will be only cars.  And what's more, only sedans are the future, not coupes, SUVs, station-wagons, or hot rods.

That's not 100% of what he is saying, but pretty close. As a VC, he would naturally want to invest in Sedans if that is what he believes. However, it might also be wise to consider some of those other vehicles (so to speak) for a value investment.

We fall in the social-networking+ UGC + pay-per-download + streaming camp (more to come on that). It saddens me that there are potential sources of capital that feel that's outdated.

I would also counsel to do a historical survey around consumer preferences on music consumption. Purchase vs radio vs live.  That would be more telling.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last year the legal, on-line digital music market grew 189% (still pales in comparison to p2p swapping stats of course). This year, it <a href="http://www.betanews.com/article/Digital_Music_Sales_Double_in_2006/1169052230">"doubled"</a>.  That is remarkable; kind of. Why not tripled? Why are CD sales continuing to fall?

In my view, it's a question of value to the consumer. With the increase in digital players and integration of digital players into mainstream life and devices, there is less need for CDs, hence less value to the consumer. And when a consumer really wants the best quality songs from an album (or just the ones they like), then the value of the CD is decreased even further.  That's one factor for the decrease in sales. I don't think the industry would disagree - hence the reason for these new double sided CDs with videos, etc (supposedly more value).

Additionally, with the increasing access to music via online services, which easily fits into the digital music player lifestyle, there is even less reason to buy the CD (unless you really really want the album art - all 7 or so inches of it). 

So it should be no surprise that the on-line music market is skyrocketing. But after last year's growth, it's starting it's first roll off.  Not a bad thing necessarily, but why?  Why is it that there on iPod's there are only an average of <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2006/12/11/nytimes-22-songs-per-ipod/">22 songs purchased from iTunes</a>? 

It's certainly not due to lack of media coverage. Or lack of Apple's advertising, or lack of players or lack of services (since there are <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2007/01/17/technology/global_digital.reut/index.htm?section=money_email_alerts">"nearly 500"</a> international services now). It's not lack of interest (since there are about 2.6 unique billion files swapped on p2p networks per month - we'll call that "interest").

It's due to restrictive DRM practices and interoperability issues. People want their music open to be able to use it <a href="http://wireless.npd.com/bulletin_mobile_hot_topic.html">how they want</a>.

Fortunately the answer is pretty simple - remove DRM and let market forces and innovation do their work.

Fortunately rVibe is a solid path in that direction.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p align="left"><img align="right" width="134" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/umglogo.thumbnail.gif" alt="UMG Logo" height="58" />The music industry is a funny place, a who-you-know king of place - very network driven. I found this behavior in the movie business too. It almost doesn't matter who you really are as long as you know someone who knows someone. Since there is a work-your-way-up-from-the-bottom culture, it's not entirely surprising there would be a bit of mis-trust of outsiders - and when and industry is celebrity driven, trust becomes ever more important.</p>
So, in 2004 I made inroads into the major labels along three paths. Path 1 - a friend of mine had dated a guy who was a technology business analayst at EMI. She gave me his email address and let him know he should talk to me.  We met for coffee and he looked over our plan; liked it. Passed me to the director of technology. He liked it. He passed me to the director of the newly formed group for digital distribution. She liked it. All good. More to come there.

Path 2 - one of our advisers connected me with his lawyer for help with funding. He wanted to vet out our idea with another lawyer friend Peter Shukat. This is where the celeb part comes in - Peter's clients include major names like the Lennon Estate, the Hendrix Estate, and other living majors (I don't even know).  Met with Peter and his associate (at the time, now partner) Jonas.  They liked what we were doing so much that although they had not represented a music technology start-up since MusicMaker in 1995 that they dove right in and decided to represent us as media counsel. Jonas knows everyone at the majors and made some calls. We had reviews with Sony/BMG and Universal. Great.

Third path. A friend of mine's brother is the CFO of Warner music. So he hooked me up. In the end it's all relationships. Now we were in will all four major labels.  But once you're in, if your relationships don't extend farther (or you have a celeb patron), you have to do a lot of hog-trading.

By end of 2005 we had done business and technology reviews with all four labels and they all approved. Now they just wanted to do financial reviews - see what we have in the bank - see how long they thought we would last - see who was backing us. Not so great.

We didn't have any cash, but we couldn't really get any cash until we had a deal with the majors.  But to get a deal with the majors you have to pre-pay around $250k per label to ensure their revenue.  Catch-22. No luck on our part and no celeb patronage.

We had to let the relationships die out until we could make additional progress.  And now we're here. We've re-engaged EMI and are about to re-engage the others.  Now that our software is nearly complete and we have a couple VC's interested, we should be able to navigate the catch 22 of the major labels.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[XM Radio is in legal trouble with the RIAA; the <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articleinvesting.aspx?type=hotStocksNews&amp;storyID=2007-01-19T205947Z_01_N19447215_RTRUKOC_0_US-XM-LAWSUIT.xml">courts have refused to dismiss the case</a> regarding their player/recorder, "Inno". The allegation is that XM is acting as a means to infringe on copyrights by offering a service+device that allows the recording of digital streams. These recorded streams (as files) can then be played back at will <em>and in any order</em>.  The technical term for in-any-order is "Disaggregate" (where aggregation means the selection of songs by the radio provider).  

And any order-of-play is really the crux of the whole issue. There are essentially two models that can be licensed today:  1. Radio/streaming and 2. Purchase (CD or digital download). 

Conceptually, radio is nothing more than the creation of an audio signal (stream or wireless) with music (in this case) that is selected by someone other than the listener; where the content is not controlled by the listener before the act of listening. The provider must pay a fee (rather nominal, but a fee anyway).

Purchase is nothing more than buying the rights to control a recording of a piece of music - and where control means to play that recording at will (as long as you don't profit from it). If you profit from playing the music, and you control when/how it's played, then you can get licensed as a radio.

I know it's a bit more complex than that,  buy the point is really a question of who controls the order and timing of the performance of a sound recording and how much you have to pay for that control. If you're a radio, you pay less per play than if a user is buying tracks.

So, in that view, XM Radio is infringing by collecting a fee from users under a radio license and then giving the users the tools to control the content however the user wants.  It's also why the RIAA wants it stopped (money).  Here in the download space what they are doing is known as a subscription model.  XM obviously feels differently, but I tend to agree with the court - just conceptually, I am clearly not a lawyer.

But from a business standpoint, here's how I see it going, and an easy way for XM to get out of this mess and potentially make a ton of money: Divest their Inno division (if it isn't a division, make it one and spin it off), and license the radio stream to them as a device manufacturer.  Doing this would require easing their licensing rules I suspect, but it would be worth it.  Then they can offer licenses to other device manufacturers.  I think device manufacturers would jump on it. Generate renewable revenue based on licensing. Licensing without intent to encourage infringement.  Device manufactures would be protected under the "Audio Home Recording Act."

If that doesn't get XM in the clear fully, the labels can recoup fees in a few other ways:  1. charge a "tax" to XM or device manufacturers for each device licensed (like Microsoft's Zune <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/gadgets/microsoft-zune-paying-off-the-industry-one-label-at-a-time-213677.php">arrangement</a>),  make a Napster like arrangement where users have to pay a nominal fee per song saved, or simply license the XM feed for downloads and turn it into a strong wireless download service (right now the best there availble for that is downloading to your cell phone - ugh).

But in general terms the question of who controls what, when is still problematic. Historically it's a radio versus LP issue and how much each party has to pay. It might be time for a new paradigm, with a combination of ad revenue sharing, per download charges and licensing fees. As we move closer to smart networks and network based services, that questions is going to become more and more important - and not just for music services.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ruckus <a href="http://news.com.com/Big+labels+offer+free+music+to+college+students/2100-1027_3-6151893.html">has launched</a> (again) as a college download service. It's intended as a way to get students to stop downloading illegally by offering them a free download service.  Free - meaning advertisement based. In their new model, they are doing a rev share with the labels and offering "free content" to students.  "Free" in the sense that you don't pay, but wrapped in Microsoft DRM so it can't be copied (without paying more anyway).

So, it's really an attempt to create revenue that is not dependant on sales to Colleges.  And to create revenue for a supplier (major labels) dying to try virtually anything to stop hemorrhaging money.

But I suspect it's going to be slow going for Ruckus in this space. Here's why:  The common thinking in the industry is that users are "stealing" music on p2p networks because it's perceived as free.  While this has some merit, it misses the really big point: the music on p2p networks is unrestricted and unencumbered by DRM.

So - if I am a student and I have to choose between "free and DRM-frozen" and "free", I am always going to choose free. If it was "free (with an ad)+ value add (such as tie-ins, new content, etc) and DRM-free" or just "free", then that would get interesting.   Just loosen up the DRM and you can do something with it (ie: make money).

Good luck with that Ruckus - you've got a steep hill to climb.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am not actually someone who rails against DRM (although recently it seems so). But I am clearly no fan of DRM restrictions - and more important - the interoperability issues inherent in DRM. So, I am happy to hear that, m</font><font face="Times New Roman">aybe DRM free, legal music is on the way.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/technology/23music.html?_r=2&amp;ref=technology&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin">According to the NY Times</a>, overheard at Midem, some of the major record labels are beginning to think they should offer some music in straight DRM-free MP3 format.</font><font face="Times New Roman">I suspect that the primary driver here is EMI. As the kind of underdog in the marketshare department, and as a company with some kind of entrepreneurial spirit, they seem to be in the best position and most likely to take the first dramatic steps forward. </font><font face="Times New Roman">Another funny thing about the majors - once one is onto something, they all jump right in. We could see an avalanche effect if EMI goes all the way.

If you want to drive sales up, you have to meet consumer demand - and consumers are demanding fast, easy, flexible access to digital music.  Once you take out DRM, you can deliver that. And once you have that, retailers (like us) are then are free to differentiate their services and add value to the consumer.

I am meeting with EMI next Wednesday to discuss licensing our service.  With any luck, I can take advantage of this new leaning and strike a similar deal to what we have with CDBaby - no DRM, as long as we take "appropriate measures to protect content within our system."

At the end of the day, I just want our service to give customers great access to great music the way they want it and make lots of money for the artists who make that great music. Let us do that.

As I understand Mike, he is a very operational oriented guy with a sharp eye toward margin.  I hope he also has a sharp eye on sales volume....

Deck is ready to go, I am ready (as much as anyone is every ready I suppose), and I think we've got a good story to tell.  We'll see if there is follow on interest.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just finished the VC presentation to Mike Gausling. They are not going to invest due to risk - specifically around Major label licensing. Same stuff we've been hearing. The meeting went like this:

They were running 1/2 hour late. Entered the "large" conf room in the BF incubator, handshakes all around. Passed out copies of executive summary. Plugged in my thumbdrive with the presentation. Opened and started. Intro with how we always get hit with questions about competition. Went into company history, market overview, target market specifics. Began service description.

Mike wanted to know if the licensing was exclusive (ie: exclusive supplier agreements).  Nope, it's all relationships. He wanted to know how much the licenses cost, $200k + per license.  Went back and forth about how that works.

Reviewed functionality - no problem so far. Went on to financials - reviewed numbers - no problem there either.

Came to end and this is how it went.  He's a new VC and not sure this would be his first investment. He sees the licensing with the major labels as a predecessor to a full launch and doesn't see how it can be successful without the 4 majors (eMusic didn't mean much to him). He sees it as a package - you have to go out with everything. And for him - as an investor, he is not sure he wants to put money into licenses.  His feeling is that although it's a chicken and egg situation, as an investor, having those licenses in place mitigates his risk a bit.  So - go get the licenses - and then we can revisit.

And that's just a benchmark before we get into any real due diligence. And of course, he's concerned about competitve response. Particuarly not sure if social networking is a legitimate way to do business. Not sure the audience is interested (even though our research shows otherwise). But then again he says he's not someone who knows about this stuff.

All in all, pretty much the same thing we've heard any number of times. Get the labels, then we can talk. Get a stronger barrier to entry then we can talk.  Get someone who gets this space and go talk to them.  There just are not many of those people.

So I pick up and keep going.]]></content:encoded>

		<link>https://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/2007/01/30/me-too-differentiation-branding/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been thinking about our brand a lot lately. And thinking about its place within the overall digital music market and thinking about differentiation via brand (as opposed to functionality).

One of the things about the big consumer digital music market:  it's big and there is lots of competition. For the most part, they all do the same thing and look the same way.  Our designer did some homework and came up with "they pretty much all use cool (as in temperature), metallic looking stuff with beveled edges and glass effects"  And the names and themes and brands are similar, etc.  And the functionality is often similar (a notable exception is Last.fm). In general, they are all trying to ride the Apple tail on coolness. It's become a "me too" phenom.

So, what is a company to do to differentiate? We have to look feel and behave differently.  We can do that by relying on your own inner-personality (well, app/brand/company anyway) to shine through, or we can do your homework.  Understand our competition, what they mean, what they offer, what they stand for - and offer something different. Oh - and we still have to add value. That's my opinion anyway - I don't think it's too far fetched, or anyone would disagree with me.

We have a kind of rebellious attitude when it comes to doing what everyone else is doing anyway - so going down the "not me too" path suited us.  We also did some homework and realized that we can't possibly compete on coolness, or slick design, or hardware, so we aren't trying.

Instead, from a branding standpoint we're going well away from cool/cool.  We're going "organic" and friendly. Not crunchy mind you - just way different from the rest of the pack. That's our strategy in general - do something "not me too" and add value. Starting with brand.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/emilogo.thumbnail.gif" alt="EMI" />I met with EMI today and it went well. We have had an <a href="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/2007/01/19/looking-back-engaging-the-major-labels/">on-again/off-again relationship</a> over the last year and a half, but we're finally getting to a place where we can move forward.

Our phone call went over the normal stuff - what our service is, what it does, who are demographic is and what sets us apart.  Talked about variable pricing (and if that is good or bad). They also wanted to know what our expected sales would be <em>for EMI</em>- meaning what percent would be of EMI sales. That of course leads to what they think their revenue from rVibe will be and therefore, what they can ask for in an upfront payment. And that upfront payment looks to be between $200k - $400k (that's pretty much what everyone pays, not based on our sales projections). 

Oh and what we can pay upfront will determine our place in line (they continue to have a backlog of services to license -which they have had for the last 2 years - as do the other three labels... read: we use that as a bargaining tool).

But here is the exciting piece - they are willing to explore the possibility of no-DRM for us.  Not likely to go all the way, but maybe for promotional pieces or as a guinea pig. We'll take it - great first step.

And an interesting thing I noted:  "At the corporate level, we don't have a lot of say over how the labels want to issue their content, that is determined within each label [paraphrased]".  Tells me they see themselves as an umbrella of labels and an advocate for those labels. Interesting thing - might be part of why it's so hard to get some motion going.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Did a phone call with Sierra Ventures today; the most refreshing VC I have ever had. The timing, tone and temper were all pitch perfect and it appeared he felt the same way. It felt like we were on the same page about the capital strategy, the launch strategy and the platform strategy. Also nice that it was initiated on their side, not by me.   Granted, it's impossible to know from a 1/2 hour screen - but bigger decisions have been made on less - and you have to trust your gut.

With any luck we'll do in person in the next few weeks and do follow on from there.

I suspect the major contentions in due diligence will be the cost of the major labels, the clarity and how addressable our market demographic is and the distribution of our team. But, you just never know.]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[To sell content to consumers, you have to have a license from the content owner.  I've already posted about how that works, <a href="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/2007/01/19/looking-back-engaging-the-major-labels/">here</a> and <a href="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/2007/01/09/the-majors-record-labels/">here</a>. However, since that is no small feat and not cheap and the infrastructure/bandwidth is expensive, etc etc, there is a clear market need for companies like <a href="http://www.musicnet.com">MusicNet</a>.

MusicNet provides content delivery for on-line music retailers. They provide a turnkey solution (that you can brand with your own look and feel, but the functionality is theirs) that includes player and ecommerce functions.  They are filling a bit of a market need.  They offer delivery and a far less cost of entry than going straight to the labels. Not a bad deal and in general a good thing for a startup to leverage (now, if the majors change their tune and start simple aggregate licensing, well, I see less of a need for MusicNet, but maybe they will find an additional model).

I've been talking to MusicNet for well over six months now about striking a deal. It's hard to get a lot of people in the music industry on the phone (unless you <em>are somebody</em>) and that has been part of the reason it's taken so long. Here is the other part of the reason:  they don't really know what to do with us. We're asking for DRM-free content, we have a reasonable solution for controls that the labels are interested in, we want higher quality (320kbps MP3 versus 192kbps DRMWMA) and we want to integrate their api as opposed to using their turn-key approach.  However, they have a license too, and it doesn't really support what we want.

So, what to do?  I offered what we offered to EMI - give us some promotional content in MP3 format and we'll go from there. Since they (and any other aggregator) stores backups of the original digital files in .wav (or .aiff) format, I offered to pay for converting it to the format we need - just provide us  feed.  We would do that for any aggregator who has that as an obstacle, we're doing it with CDBaby.

They are taking it back to their team to discuss. They are pretty sure they "wouldn't do it for just [us]", but it might be on the strategic table for them since the <a href="http://news.com.com/Record+labels+mull+unrestricted+digital+music/2100-1027_3-6152313.html?tag=nefd.top">industry is starting to face that direction</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We all know that the music industry has dramatically <a href="http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20061017.html">struggled</a> with <a href="http://www.riaa.com/issues/piracy/default.asp">music piracy</a> on peer-to-peer networks over the last few years and blame their revenue decline on <a href="http://www.slyck.com/story1314.html">all that illegal activity</a>.  We now see that <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,2087020,00.asp">25 million Americans download priated movies</a> as well.

Here is the thing about piracy people just don't seem to realize. Or maybe they are unwilling to discuss, or feel like they will get sued - I am not sure - but I don't hear them talk about it.  What seems to be clearly missing from the equation is that when 25 million users download movies illegally, and 9 million users are on p2p networks at any given moment, downloading 32 billion music files a year, that is a huge huge huge market. 

But the record and movie industries say it tells you people want music and movies for free and they are all bad bad pirates. However, I would suggest that what it really says is that people are desperate for on-line delivery of content that is fast, flexible and nonrestrictive. What it really says is: unfilled market need. It doesn't get much clearer than that. Even in the light of highly visible law suits, people continue to use p2p (+bittorrent) networks to get content. Demand, Demand, Demand.

So here is the solution: leave out the restrictions, add in value to the consumer and monetize that value. Once you do that, even if you only convert 10% of the "Demand" then you have a winner. ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p align="left"><img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/brahms.thumbnail.jpg" alt="brahms.jpg" />From the first moment I heard <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005RIN5?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rvibe07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00005RIN5">the Brahms violin concerto in D</a><img border="0" width="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rvibe07-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00005RIN5" height="1" style="border:medium none;margin:0;" />, I loved it. Brahms offers an incredible look into strong string writing with enormously strong melodic writing. And although Brahms is very conservative in his structural language, I don't think people don't give him enough credit for his midground chromaticism - he gets short changed as a super serious composer. And until Schoenberg did his masterful analysis of Brahms' works he was even overlooked.</p>
So - I love the violin concerto for its incredible beauty. In the simplicity of his melody lines he is able to derive (truly derive) some incredible presence. He's great with limited motivic material (think Symphony number 4 - another favorite) and here is no exception.

One of the funny things I find about this piece though is that is doesn't feel complete. Even though traditionally it's fine to end a concerto in three movements, this one just feels short. There is too much unwound energy in the final movement and it's particularly unweighted compared to the first movement. It just feels unbalanced to me. It needs a fugue or a passacaglia at the end - or something. I feel that so strongly, I actually wonder if he started another movement, but trashed it for some reason. We'll never know.

Hilary Hahn is a great soloist for this work and she does a wonderful job here. Her tone is not too ormellow like some of the previous masters who took this work on - she has a vibrancy and intensity that I think really suits the work. And her choice of cadenza is perfect. I've heard several other of the written cadenzas, and her's is right on (it helps that it was written with help from the soloist Brahms wrote the concerto for).

The recording is fine -not as clear as I like and a little lacking in depth, but warm. It'll do, but it just makes me want to hear this one live.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's all over the press and on <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2007/02/kudos_to_steve_.html">blogs</a>- Steve Jobs has <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/">denounced DRM</a>and said that Apple would definitely go participate if the major labels would allow for DRM free music.

I've already indicated where I stand on DRM - and more importantly interoperability (which is mostly Jobs' point also), so of course I am very happy to hear this. And if anyone can shift the direction, Jobs can.

But why would he do that, and particularly why now? Apple has a great closed ecosystem with iPod+iTunes and has 80% of the market. And locking people in/out is a great competitive advantage. So - why do it?

There can only be a couple reasons - and none are altruistic (revenue and margin):  1. he thinks they will make more money if they open their system 2. he thinks Apple will <a href="http://www.sda-india.com/sda_india/psecom,id,22,site_layout,sdaindia,news,15056,p,0.html">have to open their system anyway</a>, so do a preemptive strike to make them look good 3. he has another product suite in mind that won't work unless there is an open system (see number 1) 4. he thinks that the major labels are going to do it anyway and he wants out of the DRM contract so that he doesn't get caught being the old closed system in town.

Or, it could be a couple of those.  For instance:  what if Jobs wanted to create a wireless iPod that could swap songs on any wireless network with any other wireless system that had iTunes v9?  That level of interoperability would require an open standard - and FairPlay wouldn't cut it.  That system would 1. make them more money, 3. have a new suite that requires it.

Or the other two: with the recent hubbub at <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/21/yourmoney/music-web.php">Midem</a>, Jobs sees the writing on the wall and wants to be in front of the inevitable removal of DRM (and we're currently working with EMI on this - wouldn't it be funny for us to have DRM free contract before Apple?). And couple that with the Norway/EU issues with Apple FairPlay interoperability and doesn't it sell more iPods if there is no consumer backlash - doesn't it look better to be a good guy, fighting for the right to iPod?  Or maybe he just doesn't want to get into a protracted legal situation with multiple Euopean governments (I am sure that can't be fun).

Although I clearly don't know what his intention is, he's only got two motives: 1. Increase Revenue and Increase Margin. And this is one of the steps to doing that.

Not that I am complaining - I just want us to be able to sell as much music as possible - no DRM would really do that - and I don't mind if Jobs does the work for me.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have seen so many <a href="http://music.yahoo.com/">websites</a> and <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">applications</a> that are <a href="http://www.msn.com/">cluttered</a>with stuff or excess content that they become virtually unusable. Application clutter is one of my big pet peeves in UI design. It's easy to see how that happens. When you have so much content you want the user to see and easily get at, it's tempting to throw it all in. Or when you want users to click on ads, it's tempting to <a href="http://www.artistdirect.com/">embed</a> lots and lots of ads.

However I think adding lots of content and ad actually detracts from the user experience - and loyalty. It's more important to show relevant content in an easy to use/access format and make it easy to find more. So you have to make decisions around what you limit. It is really tough to do that of course.

In the online music space, there is LOTs of content. For legal download sites, there are at least 2 million tracks, and for social networking there are potentially millions of people (or 100 million in the case of MySpace). And in desiging an application it's critical to not make all that information overwhelming.  

We decided to limit our presentation of materials to two views: list and item - ie: a song. And then, within that, start with a primary "header" piece of information (ie: title and artist) with no more than 5 available actions (ie: buy, hold, recommend, burn). Then under that you can click on tabs for more information.  From an ad standpoint, we've take the Google approach - relegate them to the right side and make them simple and clear. They have nailed is and become known for simple and effective. We like that solution as well.

Then you also have to design a UI that <em>feels</em> uncluttered. To me, that one is easier than figuring out how to limit content (although our designer might disagree). More white space (or whatever color you choose), and no flashing stuff, no moving images, not tons of "album art" all over, etc. More links, and means to get at <em>additional (read: not critical) information</em> as opposed to showing the additional information.

And in limiting the available functionality to what you want the user to do (and what the user comes to your application for), you have to clearly mark those items to draw the user to them.

The advertisers have figured that out - how to capture "eyeballs" but if the sites out there are an indication, UI designers have not figured it out.]]></content:encoded>

		<title><![CDATA[Barrier to entry - differentiation &amp; quality]]></title>
		<link>https://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/2007/02/08/barrier-to-entry-differentiation-quality/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As we talk to more and more investors, I am asked more and more often:  what are the barriers to entry? This question is of course standard practice when you are not comfortable in the space. So here is the thing:  in the Internet space, there are few barriers to entry now. Capital is not even really one with development and infrastructure turning into a commodity.  So how do you compete?

We could consider supplier agreements (licensing music with the labels) as a barrier, but not that high of a barrier.  We could consider our functionality or business model a barrier - but that is not truly sustainable.

In the consumer space, there is something that investors don't really tend to think of as a barrier. And it's very hard to quantify as well (as opposed to how many patents you have). That thing is the <em>relative</em> <em>quality </em>of your product.   In this case quality means ease of use, speed, offering, customer focus and engagement. Consumers notice it and buy accordingly. It's a major differentiator in a wildly growing market.

I think of it as a "quality elastic demand curve". Kind of like price elastic demand curve except somewhat in reverse. For the digital music market, the end sale is the same: digital download of a music file.  The price is generally the same (and it appears that the consumer is fairly price insensitive anyway), so the differentiator is in the service offering.  And I think most importantly in the perceived quality of the service offering.

So what about the quality elasticity?  In this exploding market we are starting to see a glut of "me-too" products and services that apparently exist to take advantage of the market growth.  In my version of the curve, as demand increases, the quality of the offering decreases (in this case with the increase in numbers of available services).  But there is a negative effect to quality elasticity within the overall competitive offering:  users turn away in general.

So - what happens to quality when you start to see a decline in demand?  You see quality increase. That said, a smart company invests in quality upfront so that when the demand eases, the quality component takes over and your service lands on top.

That's why building a high quality service is a differentiator. And why I feel design is a major key to our success in a competitive landscape.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p align="left"><img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/emilogo.thumbnail.gif" alt="EMI" />Major news outlets are saying that some of the major labels (EMI is most noted) are <a href="http://online.wsj.com/google_login.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB117098284722103100.html%3Fmod%3Dgooglenews_wsj">starting to have talks</a>with companies about selling music without DRM. That's us.  Well, that <em>was</em>  us.  Just yesterday our negotiations with EMI broke down and told us they are not ready to do a deal at this time (our sticking point is DRM).</p>
And now Warner is <a href="http://www.tradearabia.com/tanews/newsdetails_snMEDIA_article118711.html">going on record</a> as saying that they are not going to remove DRM. I just emailed with the CFO last night and we're going to meet next week or the week after to chat - and this will be one of the things we chat about. I doubt we'll get much traction, but you've got to start somewhere.  And with Warner's sales down 74%, maybe our non-DRM/yet still protected solution will resonate.

In general, with the Jobs announcement, there is another affect: licensing deals with the majors have come to a halt.  That's a real pain.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/yahoomusic.thumbnail.jpg" alt="yahoomusic.jpg" />Yahoo and the Majors have done an "experiment" with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mp3.com/news/stories/7506.html">selling files in an 'un-protected'</a> (no DRM) format.  They did it a while ago, but comments of the success of the experiment have been surfacing with <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/">Jobs'recent anti-DRM declaration</a>. That means that on the Yahoo music service - which is a subscription, MS-DRM based service, released a few Norah Jones songs in MP3 format with no DRM.

Yahoo and EMI spokespeople have called it a success. They won't divulge numbers, but they indicate all is well. They don't indicate that it paves a high-way to MP3 distribution, but they appear happy with the results. 

Unfortunately, I don't believe the experiment actual proves anything (although I wish it did). Since we don't know sales numbers, we'll have to speculate:  let's say they sold 1 million copies of one of Norah's singles via the experiment.  There is no way to know that the reason they sold is because it was non-DRM, or because the Yahoo users were going to buy it anyway via Yahoo.

Maybe users were offered two versions on the service, DRM and MP3 and said "This one is open and this one has DRM".  Then they might have something to point to (ie: 99% of purchasers chose the MP3).  But even then, what does that say?  Was it due to language of the sale, placement of the product, ease of access? 

They can make some assumptions, but since the users are already 'locked in' via the subscription model, why would they go elsewhere to purchase the track, and why would they would see a need to buy it in MP3 versus DRM?  They wouldn't. 

But in general, I think the issue is that anyone who signs up for Yahoo music knows they are getting a subscription and DRM based service, so they are comfortable with that and don't see a need for getting music in MP3 format.

Now let's turn it around - what if a service offered ONLY MP3 format (and not DRM) and they started to offer Norah Jones?  The user population would expect it in MP3 format. If you offered Norah in DRM format, the users would simply rebel. However if you offered her music in MP3 format, they would see it as an expansion of the service. 

That's the direction to go.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Of course Microsoft can beat Apple - but not the direction it's going: consumer electronics and entertainment. And it's simple - Microsoft has a process model that does not permit the type of innovation that would allow it to compete in the consumer space.   To figure that out, you don't have to look any further than the lack luster sales of Vista. 

Meaning - Vista has a big WOW factor (at least that's what the marketing says), but consumers don't see it that way or see the value. So - that's the rub - while it might be worthwhile for Corporations (at some-point) to adopt Vista, Microsoft has not addressed a core need for the consumer. 

Now, there might be bigger forces and trends here - like migration away from desktop computing, but I don't think so.  Microsoft has a very vested interest in maintaining control over the desktop computing environment and that's where they focus their energy - incremental improvements with planned obsolescence for products. And when your consumer is locked into your product, that means a cash cow.  Protect the cash cow = lack of real innovation.

In Apple's case, they have a process model based on design. No necessarily innovation, although that does fit in.  That means that they see the consumer as essentially design friendly and target their products that way. However, from an innovation standpoint they don't really take the prize - the're rarely first to market too (iTunes is no exception). That said, since I believe they have rightly identified the consumer as design friendly, and their model focuses on design, they're in good shape.  I do think they will hit the cash cow syndrome (and you can start to see that with the iPods of late - not including the iPhone).

But what about an innovation model?  That one is tough since consumers are a fickle bunch in general. However, if the innovation is really good, and the design is really good, then you might have a winner (even if there is not necessarily an apparnet market need). 

The challenge with an innovation process focus is in not getting the cash cow syndrome. And that takes guts to be willing to throw out what you have to do something better.  And I don't think Microsoft is willing or able to do that. ]]></content:encoded>

<font face="Times New Roman">Right now, I can tell you that the Zune team is really focused on producing great innovation in the music device space. When you have a guy who has 80% market share and has sold as many devices as Apple has, you gotta be focused on home cooking, so to speak. I wouldn't expect there to be much focus beyond what we're trying to do in the core music space.</font>

That is the mindset - around each one of their product suites - and you can see that play out in their incremental changes. Gotta take care of the cash cow first, innovate second.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We're exploring adding a webcast piece into our the rVibe service and I think it's the right way to go. I'm not going to go into too much detail, but suffice it to say that any user (non-subscription) can listen to an embedded webcast on any site where it's embedded. And that webcast can be in-effect created by any user.  And that allows some additional functionality that is the killer-app part.

The only question is to what degree it will conform to section 114 for statutory licensing. Now, I am no lawyer, but I think we've sorted it out - and yes we will. It just comes down to the degree of "consumer influence" over what is played and the audience for whom it is played.  In our case, I believe we're on safe ground for statutory licensing as long as our business logic conforms to the playlist rules (no artist repeats in a three hour time, etc). That might mean modifying the user generated webcast list, but better that then face the licensing consequence.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Even with all the research I do on competition and emerging technologies, and all the research I have done, I constantly come across things I should have seen a long time ago.  Last night was the "Web 2.0 directory" <a href="http://go2web20.net/">Go2web20.net</a>.  It's a great resource for anyone looking for startups in the "web 2.0" space. That of course means anything with "Social Network(ing)" in it's functionality, or "user generated content" or "tagging" (a mashup of  UGC and SN).

I know it's been much discussed, but I think the moniker "web 2.0" is just silly. In my view, it's just a marketing term to generate buzz.  The technology and the business models have been there since "web 1.0" so it's really nothing more than the normal evolution of functionality usage and branding.   Of course rVibe is "web 2.0" in all it's glory (with some other stuff), but the technology, frankly, is all web 1.0.  And so is Youtube, and delicious and MySpace.

But, I'll happily take and use some of that buzz.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We've taken delivery of our first set of content from CDBaby - around 1 terabyte of data. Not bad; we have about 14 more to go. We took it in FLAC format so we could massage the conversion to our liking - since we're offering a higher encoding rate than other services  (no skin off our p2p based teeth = no cost to us). 

The initial coversion should take about 2 days and reduce the size to about 750GB. Then we're going to store everything on Amazon S3 (back up and seed files (should we need them)).  We have a pretty fast line, but I am sure that upload is going to take a week.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/rvibelogo.thumbnail.jpeg" alt="rVibe Logo" />We're headlong on development and wham hit a data issue.  The trouble with social network data in our case is not just the many-many-many relationship, but also the incorporation of a rich data set within our client software.  And that data in the client needs to be synced (so to speak) with the client database.  This is a very tricky thing to begin with, and when you make any schema change, it gets far far far worse.

We're right back to the importance of building social network and eCommerce in from the beginning - you just can't tack it on later.  I really feel this strategy is a pretty substantial barrier to entry for any company developing a music product with social networking.

The lastest nightly build for our release was toast. We had to refresh everything in the database (on client and server) and start over with a new build. Ugh.  Not a setback, but an important event to happen anyway.

Note to self - it's so much easier to have a single web database without multiple client databases.  Not as much fun or value, but easier.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p align="left"><img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/umglogo.thumbnail.gif" alt="UMG Logo" />Met with the CFO of Warner Music. Not only a really nice guy, but super articulate, thoughtful and smart.  Everyone gives the music industry such a hard time (and often rightly deserved),  but one thing they are not, is stupid - well at least in this case.</p>
I offered our take on things and the direction we'd like to take our model (ala carte/membership/streaming) and he is very open to it. He is open to no DRM - as long as there are controls in place to limit file transfers within a PC....and a MP3 player.  So - that is tough - what they want to avoid is someone taking a full MP3 player and copying those files to another computer.  So - that's not so hot for us.

But I think it points to an interesting solution. In stead of putting controls on the file (and causing all kinds of interoperability problems), put firmware level controls on the device for hooking it up to a computer for transfers.  Meaning - install a piece of software on a computer  (ie: downloaded from the manufacturers web site, or bundled) with a unique identifier that writes that unique identifier to the device.  Only the computer (or another, or however many) with that same software with that unique identifier would be able to do a transfer.  You'd have to be able to write down that unique identifier or get a master one or something in the event of a hardware failure - so that is a piece of logic to work out still.

There we go - DRM interoperability problem solved.  Any device manufacturers interested?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There is lots of talk about the losses in CD revenue due to p2p sharing. There is lots of talk about the exploding digital music market (that's a phrase I like to use when talking to investors), and now there is <a href="http://" title="http://news.com.com/Music+executives+judge+Jobs%2C+lament+losses/2100-1027_3-6162729.html">talk from industry executives</a> about needing to get the revenue flowing from consumers in the digital music space. And when <a href="http://" title="http://www.appscout.com/2007/02/digital_music_forum_the_suits.php">these types of discussions</a>happen, recently they revolve around DRM. And DRM of course is a major problem and near and dear to my heart.

But I think there is a second looming problem that people in general are not discussing (with maybe the exception of the long-tail crowd):  overall lack of licensed music. Current estimates put the total number of unique copyrighted tracks on p2p networks at around 25 million.  Now let's assume that represents 25% of ALL recorded music. If all that music were digitized and made available on-line, we'd have 100 million unique tracks from which to satisfy all our musical needs.

Right now there are only 2 million tracks available. And I think that hinders digital sales (in addition to DRM issues).

The answer:  license as much music as possible as quickly as possible. For EMI et al., to reach into that back catalog and get licenses going.

But here is the issue:  the major labels don't have much of an incentive to do so. The 80 of the 80/20 rule of their sales come from current music sold to 15-25 year olds. The rest is not really valuable. Don't waste the money on the licenses, theyu think the ROI is just not there for them.

Of course, that might just be because shelf space costs money and production costs money, and there does not seem to be a large enough return.  But I think it's wrong.

Yes, I am a fan of long-tail thinking, but even less sophisticated is this: people want lots of different types of music and they are willing to pay (particularly older demographics).  And at least in the case of rVibe, we can give it to them and be profitable.

I have always said that we would be happy to subsidize and facilitate back catalog licensing (of course we'd want some exclusive rights for a period of time), and I feel that way more than ever. I would love to sell all that 'old' music, I really really would.

And doing so - I think that would not only solve issues with declining sales, but also facilitate a true conversion to digitial distribution. ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/umglogo.gif" title="UMG Logo"><img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/umglogo.thumbnail.gif" alt="UMG Logo" /></a>Met with technology officer for Warner.  We spoke well over a year ago when watermarking was actually a possible alternative to wrapper DRM.  Of course, that has gone by the wayside since then.

This time our discussion focused on "protecting payment"  (that's how they see it, not controlling files) for downloads and on our streaming piece.  First - the streaming piece we're putting in should be no problem (at least technologically) and they should be fine with what we have.

They are also open to doing something with us as long as we can control how files are manipulated on MP3 players (iPod included). What that means is that they don't want open MP3 files on MP3 Players where you can take an MP3 player, attach it to another device and allow it to copy files over free and clear.  If we can "reasonably" restrict that (and he is aware that no system is unhackable), then they are open to further talks.

Based on the discussion, I am confident that our PC side covers their needs. However, our MP3 player integration does not cover their needs.  So we are going to explore some other means to get MP3s onto a player and not have them be able to be easily read into other systems.

Two out of three is not bad, but we really need that third piece.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Fred Wilson (can you tell I read his blog?) also <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2007/03/dumb_money.html">just posted</a> on how he is seeing a lot of "dumb" money around - as in bubble money. I think he means VC's who throw money at companies when they don't understand the space, the product or the team.... I think.

I am pretty sure I know what smart money is, but I am not so sure what dumb money is. However, I have always preferred smart money. That means an investor/team that knows our space, has operational experience in consumer products and "gets it" (which is tough for the emerging music and social space).

That said, dumb is a very very relative term - and most important to us is a very smart partner - regardless of background.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For as many projects as I've been on, I should be used to it, but I'm not.  Inevitably, when you near a release, a billion things come up that we not fully expected- those little details that matter so much in a consumer product.  You often nail the big ticket items, but you just can't leave the little ones - they hang people up and give you a bad rap.

So we have slipped out private beta 1 until Friday of this week to work on those details.

And no matter how many times I see this happen, it still makes me cringe/boil/laugh/cry. 

The solution?  Have really great developers who are both creative and thoughtful and know how to deal with issues as the arise.  It just proves again why it's so important to fully vet your vendors and really interview your staff. ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/xm_logo.gif" title="XM Logo"><img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/xm_logo.thumbnail.gif" alt="XM Logo" /></a>I like XM (or Sirius) as a concept (audio delivery virtually anywhere). I actually like using it and have it in my car. But the quality of the audio drives me nuts.  It's like listening to 64Kbps MP3s - and it might be that level of compression. They were playing Avril Levigne's <em>Complicated</em>and there is this harmonic overtone thing filtered through some kind of sine-wave thing in the bridge and I could almost hear the drop out - it was a mess. Then I switched over to classical and it was Haydn Symph #104 (a classic for his trickiness - big dramatic exordium in the exposition then right into a light theme 1) and that was a mess too. The strings aresomewhere between noisy mush and electric guitars. Total lack of definition.  

Am I being too hard?

Maybe, but there is a business problem as I see it.  They have chosen to deliver audio in an ultra-compressed format to save on cost - fine.  Except that the quality of the audio is degraded. As a user, that's no good. If I had a choice of higher quality audio with coverage like that of XM, I would certainly choose it. And that is a business problem.

Enter cellular or wi-fi radio (or audio delivery). It's not there yet, and the cellular carriers might balk at the bandwidth needs, but that would do it. Higher quality audio, selection, etc and enhanced delivery options. And just like that, XM would be done.

When MP3 first hit, it was all about mass consumption of music and quality didn't matter as much.  Satellite radio is similar - all you can eat for one low price - at the cost of quality. But now that the offering has become common place, the next question is going to be quality. 

So - the current offerings are XM (64kbps-96kbps or so) and the standard download fare (around 192kpbs). All have quality degradation. The services offering it prefer the smaller file sizes because it reduces the platform costs - but not because the consumer really wants it.

That's why we're offering 320kpbs. I want my music as close to CD quality as possible.  And as a p2p platform we can offer it while incurring minimal cost. Well, at least until ISPs figure out how to charge for use of the edge of the network.

Why not offer full CD .wav files?  The bandwidth is not there yet for consumers. When we all have FIOS or I2, then maybe.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's so close, I can almost taste it.  Private beta 1 is in the final stages of completion. There are any number of things that will have to be fixed (mostly cosmetic and data related), but I can accept that right now. Mainly I want to get it out there, see it work and get some user feedback.

I really do love this stuff - building a cool product, developing the market around it and plugging it in - it just doesn't get much cooler than that.

But wow, am I tired today.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/rvibelogo.thumbnail.jpeg" alt="rVibe Logo" />When engaging in selling a consumer product that has not launched, you can choose any number of methods to market it.  The standard one is to hype it up - use press releases, create interviews and reviews and get friends excited, start ad campaigns, etc.  The less standard one is not hype it, but instead tell some key people who might be interested.

That's what we're doing - for good or ill. Some would be critical of not trying to generate lots of buzz, claiming you can only grow with lots of chatter around it.  But I would suggest that creating buzz prior to a launch might actually hurt things.  Here's why:

It's easy to create buzz. But buzz is just curiosity and it's difficult to live up to the expectations you set. So - instead of getting your user excited and then disappointing them, let the product speak for itself. It may slow the initial number of sign-ups, but I believe you will have lower churn and higher retention.

Oh, and you should build in a way for people not only create their own buzz, but <em>want</em> to create their own buzz.  We've done that too.]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/emilogo.thumbnail.gif" alt="EMI" />It finally happened, one of the majors has moved to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN0134595820070402?&amp;src=040207_1409_DOUBLEFEATURE_top_news">sell music without DRM</a>.  We've been predicting it would happen since the end of 2005, and it was just about right.  So - now what for rVibe?  We'll work to re-open our negotiations EMI and get the ball rolling on a DRM-free license. It seems we should have the right pieces in place to do it - DRM-free, open format, higher quality files - not a bad story to tell.

I am happy about it - I think feature to feature, rVibe competes well with Apple, Napster and the like. The major competition will really be from website based download services, but then they have other loyalty problems...

More to come on how it goes.]]></content:encoded>

<p align="left"><img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/rvibelogo.thumbnail.jpeg" alt="rVibe Logo" />In my view of things, there are two types of external relationships you can have in a company - a vendor or a partner. And it's not always clear which is which. </p>
My definition: A vendor is a person or company that provides a specific service at a specific cost with expected deliverables. A partner is a person or company that has a mutually beneficial relationship where both parties absorb some of the cost and both have something to gain.

I generally prefer partnerships and actively seek them in every relationship we have. It shouldn't come as a shock to me, but it always does - how often companies just are not willing, or able (and that is often the case) to engage in a partnership.  They just don't have the framework or infrastructure to support a partnership.  Amazing.

But vendors can be good too. You can drive vendors and can cut costs out of vendors. I don't particularly enjoy doing either and it feels a bit slimy to me - but it can be highly cost effective to use a vendor and drive them to their promises. You just cant't be scared to push hard, and ultimately it's better for everyone if you do.

For partnerships there is a cost factor as well - if you do it right.  Squeeze out some of our cost by adding risk back to the vendor for greater payoff in the future, or by adding some other value back to the vendor.  Companies with an entrepreneurial spirit will actively engage in partnership - they are less risk averse (for so many reasons) and seek value in addition to cost savings.

We have over 10 vendors or partners (not including your normal utilities, insurance, etc) that we work with and all told I think we've saved around 70% off of expected costs by building strong partnership relationships and by hard vendor management.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been getting question after question about the EMI/Apple <a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=17702">announcement</a> that they are going to start selling DRM-free AAC files in higher quality format.  Mostly these questions are:  1. Why is this a big deal 2. What does it mean to rVibe 3. Will this mean greater competition for Apple?

Let me start with this general statement:  people who have already signed on to iTunes (or Napster, or Yahoo - any DRM'd service), generally already either accept DRM or don't know they are getting DRM files.  So, in that case, it really does not matter if the files are DRM free or not.  However, if other services start offering DRM files exclusively (like rVibe), then that DOES matter.

Why? For many people, myself included, DRM has been a reason to NOT use commercial services. So - I am just not going to rush over to Apple to buy some of their tracks that are DRM-free (and, not all are, so how do I select them)?  When I go to rVibe, I know that everything is DRM-free - so I am confident that what I get is just that - DRM-free. No issue.

In terms of competition, it's important to remember that Apple is first and foremost selling iPods and that iTunes is mostly a type of loss leader for iPod sales. So, I don't think it will increase competition for selling iPods, but it might increase competition for iTunes, but from Apple's model (selling iPods), I just don't think it's a big deal for them.

The far bigger deal for them is making a showing to the EU that they are trying to drive interoperability. I believe that Apple's real goal in opening the DRM environment is risk mitigation from legal compliance issues.  That would be a much bigger blow to Apple than some domestic competition for iTunes.

In terms of rVibe, yes this is a big deal. And for the rest of the online distributors out there that have DRM-free services (how many are there now - like 5?) it's a big deal.  But only if we can afford a DRM-free license with EMI.

<a href="http://www.jambase.com/headsup.asp?storyID=10256">Some reports</a> show that Apple paid $5 million for the DRM-free license with EMI. That is a very steep price tag (which seems to bolster my theory about risk mitigation on the part of Apple).  EMI currently is tanking on earnings and is a <a href="http://www.financialnews-us.com/?page=ushome&amp;contentid=2447527015">target for acquisition</a>. To prop up that price or avoid take over, they need to show some top line growth.  Easiest way to do that is to get a high pre-payment for a DRM-free content - hence the $5 M price tag for the DRM-free license.

However, that is a one time revenue from Apple which is nice, but means they have to do it again and again. There are only a few companies that could support that (Yahoo, MSN, Wal-Mart, Napster (maybe), <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/04/06/1227239">Microsoft</a>), and most of those depend on DRM for their business model (subscription).  So - I suspect EMI will entertain anyone with deep enough pockets for a DRM-free license - which is a very short term strategy since they will quickly run out of clients.  And, that prices us out.

If they offer a DRM-free license at a reasonable rate, then we're good to go - and it would be a great step for rVibe.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/libana.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Libana" />I love the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lullaby-Collection-Various-Artists/dp/B000002M78">Swedish Lullaby</a> from <a href="http://www.libana.com/">Libana</a>- it's gorgeous. I sing it to my kids (albeit not like she does).  The interesting thing about the performance is that it seems to adhere to more "folk" traditions. Meaning, the meter is not square, it seems to vary, and the speed at which she sings varies based on where she is in the tune. Also, she bends some notes at key places in a very traditional manner. I love that - we don't see much of that type of sensitivity today, and it's refreshing in a sea of 4/4 sqareness.  Oh - and her straight tone is just beautiful.]]></content:encoded>

<p align="left"><img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/irons.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Irons in the fire" />The CEO's job is to manage all the aspects of the business as well as be accountable for delivery and profitability. </p>
The phrase comes to mind: "Irons in the fire".  Meaning, the blacksmith literally has many irons in the fire and has to make sure that as those pieces of metal get worked, that they are kept at the optimal temperature for forging.

But the other pieces are: keeping the fire going, making sure there is fuel for the fire and making sure there is fire protection should an errant spark fly...and have someone there to work it with you in case you're incapacitated.  The blacksmith also has to make sure that someone buys the end product and should there be an issue with the product, that it gets fixed - while making sure the current new irons stay at the optimal temperature.

Meanwhile, the Blacksmith needs to ensure that the cost of the iron doesn't outstrip the price of the final product (and ideally the price of the final product far outstrips the cost of production) Lastly, there always needs to be enough capital to get more iron to keep the process going.

And for the entrepreneur, all that happens <em>after </em>you get off the ground (with your bag of coal, matches, iron, and anvil).

Just working through the details of launching rVibe.  ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/rvibelogo.jpeg" title="rVibe Logo"><img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/rvibelogo.thumbnail.jpeg" alt="rVibe Logo" /></a>Technology entreprenuers are prone to saying "We don't have any competition" or something like "our service will out-google google".  Both are silly and naieve - and impossible to believe. I fell into that trap when I first devised the scheme for rVibe in 2003. At that time I thought it was true. Of course, as an application with p2p underpinnings, it couldn't have been farther from the truth - can you say Napster?

You have to know your have competition, and you have to know how you're better. And in the consumer space, why people will choose you over the competition.  But the thing that I think is so interesting about competition is the fear factor on startups.  Competition is terrifying. Nobody really wants to compete - becuase nobody wants to lose. It's that risk averse part of all of us.   And this is true for investors as well.

However, I like think about competition differently. Competition is an indicator of market presence and also helps you steer away from pitfalls. If there are serious competitors (and even better if they are making money), then that typically means there is a worthwhile market and that you're not off your rocker for wanting to enter it.

But the thing I love most about competition is this:  Competitors find the problems for you. Even the most successful competitors have issues, or gaps or things they missed.  I am sure we are no different, but it's so nice to see what other people are doing - it's so much better than not knowing.  Allow them to make mistakes, or narrow their focus to something specific.  When they do those things, that shows the way to a new product, market or opportunity. Likewise for competitive response - it tells you where you may have gone wrong and how to address the issue.

The thing missing in the online music space?  Well - one of the many anyway - a music client with social networking, rewards, free and paid streams and all the normal player functions.

And by social networking, I don't mean it as the total focus, I mean it as an integrated part of the application experience.  Music is a social experience, and so is software (note - it's part of the experience - it's not <em>the</em> experience).]]></content:encoded>

<p align="left"><img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/rvibelogo.thumbnail.jpeg" alt="rVibe Logo" />It's fairly well understood that of the multiple kinds of marketing, when you look at interrupt versus non-intrusive, educational or word-of-mouth marketing, or viral that the latter is almost always more effective.  It's also a lot cheaper.  So - why would we want to spend lots of money on interrupt driven marketing (TV, print, banner ads, street give aways, etc)?  Because it builds brand awareness quickly. </p>
But, since we don't have the cash on hand to do a massive interrupt driven campaign, and I'm not convinced it's a good use of money anyway, we're going down the less intrusive path - one that many tech startup's are doing:  1. get our network to do our work for us.  But in this case, we're paying out network to do that. 

If you use rVibe and you like it - then advertise it for us - we'll pay you.  Pretty simple.  Pretty straight forward. And the infrastructure is already in place.  Pretty cool.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/rvibelogo.thumbnail.jpeg" alt="rVibe Logo" />Getting people to pay for this is the hardest part about online music; when you can "get it for free" why pay?   And offering free software in our case does not seem to lend it self to getting people to pay for music. And when you offer a more limited selection than what is available "illegally", it makes it even more difficult. And when (in the case of Napster, iTunes, etc), you offer it with restrictions, it makes it even more difficult.
<p align="left"><img align="left" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/cashregister.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Cash Register" />However, people are paying, so what's the deal?  Value add and low barrier to payment.  People are willing and happy to pay for things where they perceive added value. So - in the case of online music services, it's not just about having the content, its in how you get and how well you get the content.  In the case of iTunes, it's the iPod - in the case of Napster or Rhapsody it is the subscription model and perception of low priced content. </p>
In our case, it's the social networking, the recommendations, and the rewards. And, we've gone the account route - deposit money (that may already be accruing from rewards or affiliate click throughs) and it dramatically reduces the barrier to purchase.  Once the money is in there, there is an incentive to use it.  And getting money in there is painless since it's a "deposit" instead of a payment.

How do you get people to pay? Add value and reduce the barrier to payment. Are there other ways?  Sure - force a situation where the consumer has to pay, but that doesn't work in online digital assets.]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Identity formation is a fascinating thing in general, and in the burgeoning online social networking sites it takeson an additional angle.  Danah Boyd talks a bit about it <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2007/04/03/incantations_fo.html">here</a> for reference. 

On most social networking sites, you get standard fields of input for defining your identity in addition to name, etc:  1. Favorite movies, TV, books  2. something about your self, 3. where you went to/are in school, 4. job/income.   Typical ways that you might think of defining a person.  But I am not sure that really means much - and Danah also suggests that it's the network that actually means the most (particularly for younger and older folks). 

In the music social space, I think it means even less.  Think of a band scene. While such a scene will often be populated by a similar set of demographics, there will be some scenes that cut across demographics.  Now extract the music from that scene and I think the music will cut across even more demographics.  So now, in that case, in terms of music preference, what does identity mean?

You might assume that certain preference groups will spring up - clusters (eg: social network) of people around a specific topic (artist in this case), but I don't think that's the case. Or you might think these cluster would evolve around a particular music style.  That might be closer, but not quite there.  Think of the groups on MySpace around an artist - although they might have a large membership, first they are transient and second the group helps define the user.  

But attempting to cluster people artificially around an artist, or genre, or year, or label just won't scale. It might work a bit for a while or in limited functions, but the "fan club" only goes so far around a specified target.

So, I suspect there is going to be one consistent driver for social formation around music preferences.  And it's not artist, or genre (where even top 40 is a genre).   My question is this though:  Is the driver a music related item (ie: tempo, tone, etc) or a social item (how it makes me feel, etc), or in the social ties (I like it since it came from her/him)? 

Once you define music preference and identity in terms of the social network, things change quite dramatically in thinking about music delivery. Why on earth would I assume that you would like something because it's popular? Or because you have a lot ofbluegrass music on your computer? Or because you have listened to a lot of Arctic Monkeys?    "This artist sounds like that artist, so you might like it."   It just doesn't mean a whole lot.

Don't get me wrong, it does work a bit, but I think the social stamp on music preference is the real killer.  But not just because someone else is listening to it right now.

It's because someone recommended it you. The strength of the social tie is critical and the recommendation demonstrates it. And when your identity is built on your network, your ties are everything.  So - more successful recommendations mean stronger ties and and stronger ties clarify your identity.

And once that is clarified, we can now get down to the business of accurate recommendations and predictions on song growth.   But I am not going to tell you how we do that.]]></content:encoded>

		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/2007/04/25/fatthin-client-and-differentiation/</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/rvibelogo.thumbnail.jpeg" alt="rVibe Logo" />Here's an obvious statement:  there are so many web sites out there (by website, I mean n-tier server architecture with a web server delivery mechanism which is accessed via a thin client/web browser).

In the on-line music distribution space there are also many websites out there.  In the social networking music space there are starting to be many websites out there. It's proliferation!  It's web 2.0 proliferation!  It's a differentiation nightmare! 

Yes, I know - web sites are lightweight, fairly easy to build, and capital efficient (at least to launch). Yes, the barrier to user adoption is typically low, leading to rapid user adoption. They are also on the way to becoming ubiquitous - which is a real problem for new market entrants.  And since they are limited in manipulating the hardware they tag along on, they are also limited in their functionality - limiting the experience for users.

All of which is why rVibe is a fat client.  For music delivery and management, a fat client has a better user experience, better long term retention, richer functionality, stronger differentiation.

Now of course, I've heard that desktop applications are obsolete, out-dated and dead.  The writing is on the wall - the bells are tolling. That on-demand computing (a la Google applications) is the next wave and we're onto a thin client revolution.

Of course in the late 90's we said the same thing for desktop computing - and originally VAX terminals were the hardware equivalent of thin clients.  It's simple - desktop computing is here to stay - that's all there is to it. Even when the devices get smaller and the notion of hand held, laptop and desktop merge, there will still be desktop applications. 

HOWEVER - you can't rely solely on the desktop environment. You have to tie into the lightweight web environment as well.  Maybe that means a web interface that mirrors your desktop environment, or RSS feeds, or some other "widgets" that leverage web-only technologies.  Whatever it is, you have to have some of it.

And conversely, if you're a web only application, you should have a desktop computing component to flesh out your offering. 

So - we chose a fat client as our primary product and thin elements hanging off of it.  Some others (Last.fm, Goombah) chose the opposite approach - web primary with a secondary fat client.  

I like the loyalty that a fat client brings.  It's harder for a user to part with an installed application than to move on to another website.  Similarly, I expect we'll see slower user ID churn (where users create new IDs and discard old ones), leading to a more stable experience.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/rvibelogo.thumbnail.jpeg" alt="rVibe Logo" />We strive to do innovative things - not just for the sake of being innovative - but for the sake of driving value to our customer, our company and our investors.  To that end, we are working to lower costs, while increasing revenue (could it be more basic?).

In our space, one of those big costs can be/is marketing.  To be really effective, centralized advertisements (where you place ads that are distributed from a central place - like MSN, or Federated Media) is also really expensive.

And ultimately, the cost of marketing lowers the value of the service to the consumer. Meaning - they don't get anything worthwhile out of it (other than maybe a good feeling that they are a part of something with an advertised brand identity).

So - we're putting advertisting in the hands of our users.  Not telling how - but more to come.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'll go ahead and weigh in on <a href="http://technorati.com/search/http%3A%2F%2Favc.blogs.com%2Fa_vc%2F2007%2F05%2Fthe_mid_life_en.html?sort=authority">the age question</a>. 

In my view, age really has very little to do with things. It's really about an innovation mind set, your assumptions and the tools (skills, risk tolerance, network, etc) you use to execute what you think of.  So - if you're 45, you'll have a different set of tools than a 25 year old. But the innovator's mind set is the same.

Whenever I interview anyone, I look for intellectual curiosity. That is fundamental to anyone I want on my team (other than button pushers, but that is for something else).  Innovation stems from intellectual curiosity. And intellectual curiosity is found at any age.

Me, I am 35. I am constantly working to hone the edge of my tool set. 

The other question here is one of self-full-filling prophecy. Is the success chart that Valleywag shows due to the entrepreneur, or the VC?  If a VC will only invest in people under 30, well, then - you'll get success stories only from people under 30.

To me, that is the antithesis of intellectual curiosity.  Kudos to Fred Wilson for not playing that game.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[[...] My take is the importance of intellectual curiosity filtered through experience and neither of those are necessarily age dependent. However, it&#8217;s important to note that age does typically deepen experience and in many cases intellectual curiosity (if it doesn&#8217;t turn into cynicism). The converse to that is that experience also dulls a person&#8217;s ability to think in novel approaches. However, I tend to believe that experience trumps youth. [...]]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We have all used software that is ugly, difficult to use and does not perform as expected.  I won't name names, but you know what I mean.  Sometimes we'll overlook the issues because the function they provide adds value to us, sometimes the value is not enough.

In my view, even if you provide significant value, you must have all those little details working.  And in a competitive consumer market, that is super critical.  I am not saying that we have every detail perfect, but I just can't let rVibe go out into even a limited beta until it does those core things and does it without significant error.

So we have two key bugs left that we're working on before the beta goes out (and this does not have full functionality yet) - one minor and one major:  1. Credit card processing is not accepting credit cards (it's an internal db issue - this is pretty easy) 2. p2p audition/download is not working consistently. 

This second one has me befuddled and frustrated.  In principle it's actually a really minor problem - id an active client with the with desired track, and serve it up.  The challenge is in programmatically scrolling through the clients to determine if they are active before handling an address off to the requesting client. 

We're getting there though - and I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just came back from a much needed vacation - and right in the middle of getting ready for a release. Either I am crazy or I trust my team to deliver. Or both.  In either case, I like to read - a lot. Mainly non-fiction these days, but on vacation I do enjoy some good escapist work. 

<img align="left" width="82" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/alexandria.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Alexandria Link" height="82" style="width:82px;height:82px;" />I read the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alexandria-Link-Novel-Steve-Berry/dp/0345485750/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-6151493-3534321?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1181161306&amp;sr=8-1">Alexandria link</a> - it was good - not so fresh feeling, but well done, well thought out, an interesting theory and executed strongly.  A little Indiana Jones, a little Da Vinci Code. Engaging and fun.<p>

<img align="left" width="86" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/traveler.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Traveler" height="85" />I also read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Traveler-John-Twelve-Hawks/dp/1400079292/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/104-6151493-3534321?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1181161320&amp;sr=8-2">the Traveler</a>.  That felt a good deal more fresh. Not as well executed - meaning in some ways the author (whoever he/she may be) seemed to be a journalist reporting rather than a fiction writer. That can be good - but it laked a bit of richness.  I still really liked it - it was very engaging and hard to put down. A secret society is trying to kill off a small group of people who, after they travel to "other realms", come back an start social revolutions.<p>

<img align="left" width="89" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/mayflower.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Mayflower" height="87" />So now that I am back - I'm back to non-fiction. I've started <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mayflower-Story-Courage-Community-War/dp/0143111973/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-6151493-3534321?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1181161562&amp;sr=1-1">Mayflower</a>.  So far so good! Really is humanizing and making real the pilgrims - not as we know them, but maybe as we should.]]></content:encoded>

And we've also just decided to put in (not for beta, but in a couple releases), a place-shift stream for listening to your own music for free.  No need to upload - just install the software, register and logon to rVibe.com to listen to your own music anywhere.  Not bad.]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There is a lot of talk about the future of online music, specifically whether music we be file based or stream based. And it seems that in general people are in one camp or the other.

The streaming folks say that with increased broadband speeds and penetration of mobile broadband that users will no longer need or want digital files. The digital files people say that consumers will always want to 'own' their music and that with the decrease in storage costs (and the consequent increase in personal capacity) and increases in download speeds, that consumers will demand better file quality and therefore files will still be the medium of choice.

rVibe falls mostly in the files camp, but we're hedging our bets and going for streaming too.

But here is the real issue as I see it. For the consumer, broadband is currently all you can eat for a fixed rate, but for media hosting businesses, it's charged by the GB. That means there is no penalty to the user for downloads or for streaming, but for any standard centralized service (ie iTunes or last.fm) there is, and as it scales, the issue grows dramatically.

This problem will hit both streaming companies and download companies. For streaming companies the problem is offsetting that charge (infrastructure and royalty) with advertising or subscription fees, while for download companies it's doing the same with subscription fees or per track purchases. And for both the problem increases if file size/quality increases or bandwidth costs increase.

The iTunes take on it is to charge more for the files (of course there are other reasons for that, but margin on bandwidth/storage must be in there), but it seems last.fm is not yet accounting for that charge (that I can tell anyway - other than getting purchased).

Our view (and I think Joost shows we're not alone) is p2p as the preferred delivery mechanism for both mediums (since in the end the only difference is whether the receiving end keeps the file). However, you run into (and this is what Joost is finding out too) service availability probems with p2p, when users with long tail content don't keep their computers on.

Our current answer is to have a central backup repository, but I don't think that's really the right solution. I think the right answer is in further monetizing distributed consumer storage to drive incentive for hosting content. That's of course where we're headed - and in gen 2 when we port to mobile, we'll be able to leverage the always-on storage of mobile devices to broaden our service redundancy.

(btw - this is my first post from my motorla q, please forgive the mistakes)]]></content:encoded>

And we added some cool stuff to the website.  Beta 1 is in final testing (we have a bug that causes crashing during track scanning), and we'll be out the door. Finally, at long, long, long last.

Then we embark on the final feature additions, usability changes and overall improvements of Beta 2.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/mayflower_book2.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Mayflower" />Just finished....  If ever there was a myth-busting book of the founding of America, it is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mayflower-Story-Courage-Community-War/dp/0143111973/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-1187223-0447268?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1183299089&amp;sr=8-1">Mayflower by Nathaniel Philbrick</a>.  Lucid, devastating, sometimes darkly humorous, he details the first 50 or so years of the Pilgrim's landing, subsequent "Indian" slaughter and founding of New England. He also gives service to the European plague that wiped out 70% of the native population prior to the Pilgrim's arrival leading to the sense of space and entitlement the Pilgrims felt.

Anyone seeking to understand how American could be where it is today politically, culturally and warfare wise, really need look no further than this book.

I would have like to have seen more about the rest of the country at a macro level and more about the European thinking of the time, but that would be a bit out of scope.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lots of people love Leonard Bernstein and lots of people hate him. To know him (well - he's dead, but to know about him) is to have an opinion. Me - I think he was great for classical music - his charisma brought people to it in ways we have not seen recently. I also think he's a brilliant conductor - his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brahms-Symphony-Academic-Festival-Bernstein/dp/B0000027M6/ref=sr_1_4/002-1187223-0447268?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1183392440&amp;sr=1-4">Brahms' Fourth Symphony with the New York Philharmonic</a> is awesome.</p>
<p>However, I have never been a huge fan of his music. His writing has always felt fragmented and dated - even "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brahms-Symphony-Academic-Festival-Bernstein/dp/B0000027M6/ref=sr_1_4/002-1187223-0447268?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1183392440&amp;sr=1-4">West Side Story</a>." It seemed to me he was sticking tricks into the score for the sake of intellectual achievement rather than musical necessity.</p>
<p>But then I watched my sons listen to "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overture_to_Candide">Overture to Candide</a>" and my opinion changed. They were so engaged and enlivened by this little piece that I was able to overlook anything I thought of as artificially high brow; for them, it's just plain fun.</p>
<p>Lukas Foss does a really nice job with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Festival-Unanswered-Variations-Appalachain/dp/B000000BKJ/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/002-1187223-0447268?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1183391817&amp;sr=1-2">this version</a>. The recording is a bit quiet, but acceptable. And Lukas Foss is one of the most musical composers I have ever known. For him it must first make sense musically then intellectually. And one of the things I picked up from him is that music must have humor - which I took to mean (in addition to humor) - personality. You have to include as much personality as possible in your music. Which he does - check out Thirteen ways of looking at a Blackbird.</p>
<p>And I think Lukas' version of Overture to Candide captures that sense.</p>

There is a fine line between having rich data sets that have many different joins and having something that performs within a reasonable amount of time. We had erred on the rich set side a little much. We're working to streamline it right now and see if we can reduce the result set delivery time a bit.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/rvibelogo.thumbnail.jpeg" alt="rVibe Logo" />I just re-signed up for XM radio, despite thinking the audio quality is terrible.  Why?  For the following reasons:
<ol>
	<li>They called me and asked to bring me back </li>
	<li>They offered me 1/2 price for a year</li>
	<li>They followed up with an email</li>
	<li>They gave me online listening capability on their website</li>
	<li>They send me regular news letter emails</li>
</ol>
To me, one of the keys to building customer loyalty - is regular and personal communication (not to mention good pricing). A while back Josh Kopelman talked about "<a href="http://redeye.firstround.com/2007/04/catch_and_relea.html">catch and keep</a>" and I think one of those ways to catch and keep is email communication.

For instance, when myspace emails me that "so and so" wants to be your friend, I typically delete it. But I also have it sitting in the back of my mind that there is a message waiting for me there. And since they don't tell me anything about the message in the email, I have to visit myspace to get the message. So I do.

Or when XM emails me to say - "hey, we noticed you have 'XM Cafe' as one of your favorites online, you should be sure to listen to the live 'YYYY' on Channel 'X'" (which they don't do now, but would be really cool), I go and I am sure to listen and return to the XM environment and feel like I am part of something.

In the case of rVibe where our revenue is based on file sales and ad views, it's vitally important to have people return to our software as often as possible.  So - we're doing the "hey - your friend sent you a recommendation" emails, and "here are some new features you might enjoy" emails and having our staff make friends and make recommendations (to activate the system).

I am always open to suggestions and critcism - so please be sure to tell me what you'd like to see (more or less of).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I started this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/History-Knowledge-Past-Present-Future/dp/0345373162/ref=pd_bbs_2/103-0855784-6443054?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1183999461&amp;sr=8-2">"A history of knowledge"</a> - thought it would be fun way to get an overview of history. Well - if you like Western arrogance around what is knowledge, no scholarly references (or any for that matter) and dumbed down writing - then this is a good one.  I had to stop before I got past "Wisdom of the ancients." 

Fortunately Van Doren does touch on non-western countries, but only so much as to give them credit for certain ideas and notions - as though there was nothing else to them of importance or any linkage in anyway.  And some of the ideas that he touches on are questionable. For example, the only thing to come out of India is the Caste system.  Huh?

I realize that in 400 pages you can't really do much more than an over view, but for a book far more interesting and worthwhile with reasonable thought, check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Guns-Germs-Steel-Fates-Societies/dp/0393061310/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-0855784-6443054?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1183999736&amp;sr=1-1">"Guns, Germs &amp; Steel"</a>. ]]></content:encoded>

But the issue is this - we'll get Beta 1 out - but we may run out of capital before we have enough users to interest investors.  That is the tricky thing.  I am hoping that once we have Beta 1 out, even with minor usage, we'll see some additional interest (we've had a couple firms approach us so far) from VC's that will lead to investment.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/logo.jpg" alt="rVibe logo" />Finally, at long last, Beta 1 is here.  It's not without its issues and missing funtions of course, but the core software is solid and it's the real deal. Real content, really able to purchase tracks, really real.

Lots more to improve upon, and release 1&amp;2 are already full ahead on development.  Below is an excerpt from the email I sent out to our first round beta testers (password removed here of course).

For everyone I've neglected to respond to emails, please accept my apologies. Starting Wednesday I hope to better about it.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/logo.thumbnail.jpg" alt="rVibe logo" />Now that the private beta is out there and we have a rigorous release schedule through the end of August, we're about to look for additional capital.  I just overhauled the executive summary and am reviewing it with our partners before I start sending it out.

Beta is going well - other than this blog, have not advertised one iota, but we've gotten many many beta requests. Have not really let anyone else in yet, will start to do that after our 8/15 release, but people are interested. Once we activate our blogging friends and other "friends" it's going to get interesting.

Despite the excitement around rVibe and it's viral nature, like any company we need capital to really grow (technology, operations, content and marketing), and it's time to explore that.  Our capital strategy so far has been right on target with our planned raise amounts to get us out the door. Now that we're out the door, we're looking for a more significant round to "go up the hockey stick" as <em>they</em> say.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p align="left"><img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/facebook.thumbnail.gif" alt="Facebook" />There is lots of talk about the new <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> platform and lots of applications are cropping up. In the music space, <a href="http://ilike.com">iLike</a> is the current Facebook dominant player, but new ones appear almost everyday.  iLike has stated that their goal is to be the biggest Facebook player - and figure out revenue later. That statement captures a couple issues as I see it - first a "typical" web 2.0 issue and second a Facebook issue. </p>
There seems to be a misconception in the web 2.0 space that having lots of users/eyeballs on your site is the end-all-be-all of an application. To me that is rather silly - I always thought that running a for-profit company was about revenue.  What happens when you need to show a profit? And maybe worse, when you need to find some revenue, what will your user population do when they have to start paying for the current free service?  Not to mention that with iLike the mythology of their first few days as a Facebook app include having to scrounge for servers to keep their systems running. Ouch on the expense side.

In terms of the Facebook model, the other issue is the user population.  Well, there is actually nothing wrong with the user population as a group, but there is a problem with their expectations. The Facebook platform is free and advertising driven. Users who go there expect a free service. I am not sure you can successfully mix in non-advertising revenue models into the space and gain any traction.

So - what's an iLike to do?  No revenue model (for Facebook), a large user population with expectations for free usage?

In my view, it's better to keep your model consistent and drive forward with it. Brand and consumer expectations are the hardest things to change - why risk it to say you have huge numbers? You're just going to get into trouble.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/emilogo.thumbnail.gif" alt="EMI" />In talking with EMI a few months ago, they were comfortable with licensing out content (once they queue is reduced:  meaning we don't have enough cash to bump to the top of the list) in DRM free MP3 format. And while there have been lots of rumors of buyouts over the last few months, it seems <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/terra-firma-emi-offer-period/story.aspx?guid=%7B4B6E1590-6FBD-4144-AF1A-A4EE3E8037A2%7D">this one with Terra Firma </a>might happen.

We're hoping that doesn't effect their DRM or digital licensing strategy negatively - of course.  I suspect that it will delay any EMI offering we might be able to do, but I can't imagine they will revert to DRM.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here are some good recent <a href="http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-legal-music-downloads-growth-hit-by-cd-price-reductions-report/">stats</a>:

-- <strong>Social networks:</strong> Such sites play a growing role in music discovery and consumption, with 39 percent of all social network users having embedded a track on their profile But there’s an age gap - under-35s rate MySpace best for music, over-35s say YouTube; overall, only 16 percent of people rate Bebo top for music. Some 13 percent of users have actually purchased music they discovered at MySpace, 15 percent for Bebo, seven percent for YouTube - but <strong>46 percent overall wish it were easier to buy the tunes they find at such sites</strong>.

So - we have a solid solution - mix in an embeddable player/store into it, and tie it into our p2p system and make it a holisitic download system.  Then pay users to promote the music they love and it's a winner.

Beta is moving along, next big release is August 15th.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/logo.thumbnail.jpg" alt="rVibe logo" />When we first started up, I generated a list of Goals and Objectives, designed an organization, put together some processes for operating and generally fleshed out an entire organization for building and operating rVibe. That was two years ago - and way way way too premature.

However, now that the beta is running, and we're embarking on the next phase, I've circled back to some of those original concepts and designs. Thankfully, most were pretty close and definitely usable. Some were off - but if nothing else it attests to the importance of consistency and accuracy upfront.

So - the other thing it points to is having a good lawyer (which we do). <a href="http://www.duanemorris.com/attorneys/attorney6168.html">Jay</a> did our operating agreement and share plan plan a long time ago - and man oh man - did he get it right.

I guess what I'm saying is that we're in the process of preparing for due diligence. I'd like nothing more than to email a PDF with every applicable DD question already answered.

Getting there.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In reviewing our operations, I thought I'd just mention our organziational framework.

We've organized ourselves around our business practices. That said - we also have an overlay structure with a product and customer focus.  Meaning, here are the four practice areas (and organizational structure):
<ol>
	<li>Technology</li>
	<li>Content</li>
	<li>Marketing</li>
	<li>Operations (financial, legal, organizational)</li>
</ol>
Our focus areas are:
<ol>
	<li>Customer Development and Support</li>
	<li>Product Development and Support</li>
	<li>Content Development and Support</li>
	<li>Organzational Development and Support</li>
</ol>
On the surface the focus areas map to the organization directly, but as we grow, they  actually point more to innovation and delivery and work across the organization. Meaning, everyone in each practice area is responsible for innovation and delivery in each of the focus areas.  That leads to greater collaboration, idea sharing and energy.

Silos = bad; innovation through sharing = good.

I am not sure how well this structure will scale above 1oo people, but I think it will if we have smaller virtual teams within a larger organization.

What value does it add?  Quicker reponse time, stronger product innovation and better internal communication.  All good things in my book.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's no secret that rVibe leverages p2p for delivering content and driving cost savings, and it should also be no surprise that we're working to drive additional p2p support in our application.  We'd like to get to full functional decentralization with only a centralized authentication and authorization index server, but I don't think that's likely any time soon (especially since high-performance distributed databases are still a thing of the future). That said, we're currently exploring the balance between centralized (and therefore more reliably available) user functions versus client based delivery of functions (more scalable, but less reliable). 

The challenge (other than actually building the environment of course), is making sure users keep their computers on and rVibe running - and making sure functionality is available. And as much as I love consumers, they are not corporate data centers and might just turn their computers off. The worst case scenario is to browse into rVibe, see your friend's user avatar, attempt to access it and have it say "sorry - (s)he's not online right now." Users would quickly abandon ship. You need to have the perception of availability.  And if we want to go p2p, then we have to have real availability (we could cache stuff on regularly available computers, but I am not sure users will go for it. They might, but right now that's a future strategy).

So, I think that if we can offer some exciting functions to keep their computers on - then it will work more effectively. One of those function is receiving awards for uploads (of course). Another one of those functions will be streaming music directly from your computer (unless our lawyer stops us) to a browser for playback - aka placeshifting. Another will be some degree of remote management of your client (messages, etc). 

And here is the thing - driving the value of p2p is all about users keeping their computers running with rVibe. There has to be a perceived value to it. The question we're trying to answer is - what else would be valuable to a consumer - valuable enough for them to keep the lights on? ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The notion of planned releases for Internet software seems to be fading fast. Well, at least from a user perception standpoint. When was the last time anyone really noticed that YouTube updated their site? It's to the point that sites that announce an update seem to be antiquated.

And for fat clients that seems to be more and more true all the time as well. With auto-update features (Liveupdate, etc), the upgrade path has almost become invisible.

Of course that leads to a subscription model for paid software, but for 'free' software it's wonderful. Now you add value to your user population without them having to do any upgrade work. If you're not doing auto-update somehow, you're not going to have a long lasting product. Well, that's my opinion anyway and we're doing it.]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In a standard eCommerce retail environment for accounting you have product, cost, retail price, and profit. When a consumer purchases an item, they typically pay the retail amount of the product at the time of purchase. The retailer then collects that amount, keeps the margin, pays (if they have not already done so) the supplier and ships the product (and deals with taxes). That's rather simplified of course, and at volume it's a different story. And our simplified different story is below.

Ours is rather different. Not unique (nothing really is), but different. First we have a deposit. Then we have a transaction that subtracts from that deposit. Then if it's uploaded from a user, they get a slice of the retail price. Then we collect pay the supplier (in this case the content owner) and collect the margin. We don't really "ship" the product, but it's a download of a copy, so in that case it's "shipped." Oh, I forgot to mention that the slice that goes to the user can also go to a charity.

So - that's it in a nut shell. Now imagine trying to do the accounting for that, have it reconcile and close the books on a monthly basis. We're working to streamline it, but at the moment there is room for improvement there. I am totally open to room for improvement when it comes to back office functions. Maybe that means tools, maybe that means process. In any case, I always want to make it better.

Oh, I didn't include our operational accounting above, but that's a breeze, comparitively speaking.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/staticbuy.thumbnail.gif" alt="static buy" />There are many many moments when building rVibe is challenging (at best).  The notion of a roller coaster is way off base - unless roller coasters go up to the moon and back. But everyday I am thankful that I have the opportunity to work this project and make it what it is. And I particularly appreciate our partners and users who make us what we are.

And I am super excited about our next two releases. In the Beta 1 release we nailed the core eCommerce functionality and social networking functionality. In the next two we do a lot of clean up, performance enhancement and add a bunch of really cool stuff that I am super excited about:
<ol>
	<li>Original Content Registration for independent artists</li>
	<li>Commenting on all things (people, playlists, artists, albums and tracks)</li>
	<li>Tag and Genre browsing (I really like this one and it's different than anything else I've seen so far out there)</li>
	<li>Charitable donations</li>
	<li>Click through email delivery for viral growth (yes, that's cryptic, but I don't want to say more yet)</li>
</ol>
So - we're testing against the development environment now. I am sure there are a host of issues that will come up, but it's really flying forward now. Interim Beta 1b release set for Wednesday 15th.  Yahoo!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/ui.jpg" alt="ui1" />Well, although we have over 10,000 myspace friends, we have not activated them and have done no other advertisements. We have not added del.icio.us or stumble upon or digg links to the website or anything. For all intents and purposes we have done <em>no </em>advertising in anyway shape or form. Oh - and our brochureware website went up 3 weeks ago.

So I have been very surprised to have gotten so many requests to try out the beta. And to those many many many beta requesters - thank you for finding us and thank you for being so interested. We'll start engaging more of you very soon.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/umglogo.thumbnail.gif" alt="UMG Logo" />We met with the digital group at Universal well over a year ago and they were totally into rVibe. They approved our model and we went to business review. The big hang up we all wound up having however was DRM and they insisted on it. Well, that and they needed a hefty upfront payment.

Now they are <a href="http://www.dmwmedia.com/news/2007/08/10/universal-to-test-sale-of-drm-free-tracks-everywhere-but-itunes">experimenting with selling files without DRM</a>.  Of course, they call it an experiment, but I believe that once they go through that door they can't go back.  Which means that pretty soon they are going to expand past Rhapsody.

Which means that I need to reach out to them again, see if we can get that license done. EMI is almost there, I would love to get Universal in there too.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/pointunjntcr.jpg" alt="Point Juncture" />In designing rVibe, I really saw it from a music discovery, social networking and give-back perspective. I wasn't sure how that would affect my discovery, but it already has.

One of the gripes (for as good as they are) I have always had with services like <a href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora</a>, or <a href="http://www.mystrands.com/">MyStands</a> is that they typically show you more of what you already have. I don't necessarily want or need more of what I already have. What I need is more music that impacts me the way I want to be impacted, but music that is new, fresh and different.

And since, in my view of the music world (and I do not take the John Cage view of the music world), since music is a social experience, then the discovery of music should be a social experience.

So - my first rVibe find (and interestingly it's not "classical"):  <a href="http://www.pointjuncturewa.com/main.html">Point Juncture, WA</a>.  First new tune: Diswasher's Lullaby.

Point Juncture, WA  does this Math Rock music with some funky rhythms mixed in with some kind of drone sounds for a kind of low key trance like thing. The lead singer has a beautiful straight tone that rides nicely above any of the mess that gets made and complements the more heavy handed low end drums and rough guitars the group uses. It's not angry like Amy Lee stuff; where it has it's edge is in the dissonances they use at the end of a phrase - I love that kind of thing. 

The only criticism I have is that I can't really understand a word she says. And maybe that's part of the Point.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/bluenote_on.gif" alt="Blue Note" />While may people say that Web 2.0 is fading (at least in its glitter), to me this is an indication that it's still just starting.  Now, I am not sure what Blue Note is going to do is a good idea, but it does say something interesting.

In short, Blue Note is <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070811/wr_nm/bluenote_dc">creating a Social Network/Download store</a> for it's Jazz and Blues catalog. The download store is fine - although music download store proliferation is definately becoming a problem. The two more interesting things are the demographic and the social networking part.

Apparently the challenge for downloading within the Blue Note demographic is one of age.  Meaning their customers are "too old" - where too old = 35+ (as an aside, our focus has also been 30+).  The risk is that they are not going to leverage the site and in the past they wouldn't download music. They now believe they will (and I agree).

Far more interesting than that to me however, is that they are implementing some type of social network to drive sales. I don't know what that will look like yet of course, but let's assume it's something like: Meet a friend, see what they bought or are listening too, or what are their favorite artists and see their picture. Maybe chat about an artist, or something like that.

Of the many interesting aspects of this, to me the most interesting is the "nicheing" of  social networks and <em>here is the thing</em> the fundamental shift away from a retail store front model for selling music. 

We know that 30% of music sales come radio discovery and 20% come from personal referral.  That begs the question of what percentage might from from a less personal referral - a social network referral. Lots of people are banking on it - Blue Note is starting to and we certainly are.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There has been considerable discussion on a number of blogs about age and entrepreneurship. Some have come down on the side of younger (20-30) is better and some have come down on the side that older (30-40) is better.

<a href="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/2007/05/22/the-age-question-here-as-well/">My take</a> is the importance of intellectual curiosity filtered through experience and neither of those are necessarily age dependent. However, it's important to note that age does typically deepen experience and in many cases intellectual curiosity (if it doesn't turn into cynicism). The converse to that is that experience also dulls a person's ability to think in novel approaches. However, I tend to believe that experience trumps youth.

Now Marc Andreessen has <a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/08/luck-and-the-en.html">posted an interesting entry on luck/chance</a> - or maybe a better named - self made opportunity.  His post has fleshed out the discussion in a direction that I really like.  His notion is that being receptive to and acting upon ideas and opportunities createively as a fundamental way of operating is important and unusual and that it takes a combination of a mindset and experience to leverage operate fully. That really resonates with me.

I know many entprenuers get asked - "how did you think of that"  - I know I do.  It's important to note that the question really only comes when there is something that the person asking can see or touch or feel - not necessarily just an idea.  But that "how did you think of that" is the ultimate key - the being receptive to an idea (creative syntesis) withing a framework (disparite elements) at a certain time (context/lack of context).

Marc calls it luck. And I wonder if people who act in a creative manner are more likely to come up with creative solutions. I am not sure. I have known many many many many creative people who are definately not that. And moreso, I believe that analysis, luck (in Marc's definition) and synthesis (creativity) are the hallmarks of innovation in any number of fields. It's pretty clear in entreprenuership what that means. But you can also see it in the arts:  Picasso in painting, Schoenberg in music, Hawking in physics, Marx in Sociology - and many many more.

So, I am adding to my list of things I think are important in entrepreneurship: 
<ol>
	<li>Intellectual curiosity</li>
	<li>Creative synthesis</li>
	<li>Intensive critical thinking</li>
	<li>Energy for creation</li>
</ol>
So far that's a pretty good list.  It's missing things like delivery or focus, but that is coming.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/allogo.gif" alt="Art &amp; Logic" />While software development is not yet fully a commodity, it's sadly headed in that directoin.  However, for a software driven company, a friend of mine once said - you just don't want to outsource your heart. Of course, you can't always do heart surgery, and also it's very expensive; sometimes you have to have someone else do it.

But how to find the right set of resources to do it?  What if you don't have a bunch of them on hand? What if you don't have a ton of cash on hand? What if you have a consumer facing product (where appearance and perception is super critical)?  What if you're building a pretty large piece of software? Of course, we have all of those things - and startups often do. So - we have outsourced a bunch.

The questions of how to find the right resources came out of strategically breaking our product apart into components based on consumer interface.  Meaning - we decided it was important to have our customer facing work built by a software vendor who had deep experience in music applications, a large portfolio in user experience and strong skills in complex usability issues.   We also decided that the "backend" functionality - the guts of it - the online component, the model functions, could be done more cheaply offshore while still being highly functional and effective.

<img align="left" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/focal3.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Focal 3" />So we vetted a bunch of vendors and selected two - one on shore and one off shore. The vetting process went like this: 1. build a list of potential vendors who have domain expertise in the areas required  2. get proposals and cost estimates for the work 3. determine if they could work together  4. select from best of group  5. sign contracts.

Here is what we've found:  1. It's difficult to navigate the off/on shore two vendor path, but by no means impossible. It took about 2 months to hammer out our methodology, communications and release planning, but once it became normalized it's no problem.  2. Requirements going off shore sometimes are difficult to confirm and typically are delivered at about 75% of what you spec'd (and you find it in the first few nightly builds). 3. It's imperitive that the two vendors have a clear and <em>consistent </em>communications methodology and speak the same language (not English per se, but tech development language). 4. When vetting a vendor, unless you have a bunch of senior developers in house, you really need the top of the line that the vendor can find. You can't settle for the vendor's junior programmers.  5. This arrangement takes fairly significant management overhead - and constant constant communication and oversight. If you wait until delivery is done - you are doomed.  But with proper management integration, it's entirely possible. In many ways that's no different than in house development - there is just more of it.

And keep in mind - we get significantly higher performance from a vendor when we treat them like a partner or a valuable staff member in stead of a vendor - <em>significantly</em>.

Note however, that managing vendors to a date is much like in house managing technical staff to a date.  You can do it, but your quality and scope will dramatically suffer. In our case, we made the decision to allow date slippage (in some cases rather dramatically) in order to allow for higher quality delivery.  Granted, we're in a position of luxury to do that since we have not fully launched and don't have rigerous customer expectations, but I'll take it where I can get it.

Lastly, for offshore, if you do partner stronly with a software vendor, we found it's best to negotiate a fixed fee proposal. Don't negotiate hard with them, let it go up a bit, they will go above and beyond if you don't squash them and you'll really really get tremendous value.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Riding the growing wave of DRM free licensing, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/business/la-fi-music22aug22,1,5283460.story?coll=la-headlines-business-enter">Wal-Mart is starting to offer DRM-free MP3s for a la carte download</a>. I love it and think it's great. $.93 per download with 30 second auditions.  Fairly straight forward, normal store front model - just like Wal-Mart.  I think this is another sign of things to come for DRM - love it.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/22/business/media/22music.html?ref=media">Rhapsody and MTV</a>I don't think have a strategic sense of what this means.  Companies like Real/Rhapsody or MTV's Urge or Napster that all built business models based on required DRM have a major problem on their hands, and in my view, forming a new distribution arm is not going to help.

I am just glad we're moving toward a more open format for distribution. Now it lets the businesses play on more equal footing and allows for greater business model diversity in the market - which in this case is a good thing.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://w3.rvibe.com"><img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/logo.thumbnail.jpg" alt="rVibe logo" /></a>Generally, it's assumed that it's better for a technology service to be a platform of some type. By platform, I mean a technology solution that provides a programming interface to allow other technology solutions to hook into. That's the idea behind the current <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> technical strategy, and it's a common practice of many companies with technology solutions designed for integration. The assumption is that you can gain greater leverage, usage and revenue by being a platform. However, when creating a platform, I think some services miss it by platforming too early and pricing ineffectively.

Meaning, to me it seems that first, you need to have a successful (even moderately) application before you become a platform, otherwise you have a critical mass problem. Even <a href="http://www.snocap.com">Snocap</a> is not growing as fast as it might as a platform and they got great backing.

Also in thinking through a platform strategy, the other problems I think companies encounter as a barrier for others to adopt it is pricing.  I know when we've approached vendors that are a platform, I am very put off by high up-front costs, monthly fees and other gotchas.  It's not that I am opposed to paying for services - I love to pay for a high value service - but the payment structure is geared toward the benefit if the company (ie: predictable revenue) rather than the consumer (me).

So that said - I've decided to platform rVibe.  But only once we have some worthwhile application adoption.

We have the technical and commerce structure in place (mostly) and in the coming months we're going to layer on a robust and simple API that allows companies to leverage all the eCommerce, social networking and distributed storage functions of rVibe.  And - from a pricing standpoint, it's pay as you go - and pay only for what you use. And in keeping with adding value back to our consumers (any consumer, even b2b consumers) we will offer discounts based on how you leverage the system. If you feed back into it and not just consume it, then you can get a reduced a la carte rate. And some of the service will be free.

Path to rapid adoption.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/magazine/02rubin.t.html?pagewanted=4&amp;_r=2">Great article in the NY Times about Rick Rubin</a>.  He's been hired to essentially save Columbia Records from extinction. Or at least huge losses.  The theory is that if, as an ultra successful producer with lots of career reviving work, he can reviatilze Columbia, it will in turn revitalize the music industry.

Here is the theory he supports for turning around the industry:  1. Get the labels to make great music (again). Stop selling it first; create it first  2. Look at alternate business models:  ie: subscription models (I have problems with Subscription models).  4. Look at alternate means to get the music in to the hands of consumers 3. Start fresh, don't retool.

In principle, I agree with doing these things and I think they need to be done. However, looking at music historically, what I think we're actually seeing is a further divergance between business and creation. Meaning, where there is great music, there are people listening and artists selling those songs. There is lot of great music being written, performed, heard and sold, all around the world. The business problem is how to centralize that in such a way as to maximize the profits.

And therein lies the rub. In the current environment of further "nicheification" of all things music, it becomes more difficult to manage and centralize the realization of those profit.

Solve that problem, and you've actually solved the music industry problem.]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My last post was just a knee jerk. Now I have settled in on it and here is what I think:
<ol>
	<li>The assertion by Rick that we need to move to a subscription model assumes the centrlization of music.  This is flawed, and even his own research suggests it - people don't get their music from centralized outlets (radio, Tower Records), they get it increasingly from their friends. And to push the example, nobody would suggest the centralization of concert ticketing for all venues - it's just silly.</li>
	<li>The research done in the "Big Red" program is flawed. Think about who was in this program - college interns who have access to internships at Columbia. Could it be more demographically skewed?  Of course they think MySpace is dead, and Facebook is still cool - that's where they are. Maybe some of the concepts are good, but before you overhaul your entire business, you should do a little more homework than some interns you hired to work for you.</li>
</ol>
Additionally, as consumers and companies realize the power of niches, it's going to be more difficult to centralize the business model (as in the traditional record industry). And subscriptions are not the answer. Subscriptions work for the fairly wealthy who have no problem taking on an additional $10-20 per month (or $120 - $240 per year) for something they don't own, never will and will have to give back - or pay more to get. They also don't work for people who want to own their purchases (which is about 80% of the market currently).

But, if businesses really really want to do some kind of subscription model (for which I predict much backlash and further breakdown of the centralized business model), then it's going to have to be some artist tax that gets distributed by SoundExchange - much like for radio now, but instead for downloads. That is not so hot for revenue for most companies today; except SoundExchange.

And even if bandwidth does allow for music to "come from the cloud" - that cloud is still a real thing and still costs money. And who pays for that when the users won't pay for subscription? Advertisers - like in radio? Maybe - but that's not enough to sustain a $32 billion industry.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Regarding centralized vs. decentralized: one caveat has to be network neutrality. As blantantly anti-competitive and as non-neutrality is, the DOJ seems just fine with it. Their friends at Verizon will be able to tax the industry with their captive market and the vertical will be back 'where it belongs'.

I just read the DOJ press release that compares ISPs to US Postal Service with the reasoning that the USPS has different rates for different services, why not ISPs? Well, (hopefully) the USPS does not have different rates for 'in-house' mail vs. outsider mail. It is like the USPS going into the newspaper business and subsidizing their delivery at the expense of their competitors.

Centralization needs regulation or subsidized competition. Otherwise the economic benefits (to the market) go right out the window.

Regarding owning vs. subscribing: For myself, I don't think I agree. I love music, but don't want storage, format or portability issues. I would rather pay-per-listen - especially if I can buy in bulk, which is what a subscription is. 

Does this ever happen to you? Ever buy a great movie on DVD and never watch it? Why is that? What I want is availability. I don't want an inventory of merchandise that depreciates dramatically even when you don't use it. At least with physical things like comic books, if you put them in plasic bags and never enjoy them, they may have some investment value.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/features.html?feature=itwfms">Apple just announced </a>that you can now <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/09/05/itunes-wifi-music-store-first-hands-on/">download tracks to the new iPod touch </a>over wifi.  I love it - for so many reasons.  First, I love the idea of getting music over the air, untethered. To me that is pretty awesome.  I love it that it ties into the desktop environment - which is still central to pretty much everyone's world in the US. 

And I love it for strategic reasons for rVibe:
<ol>
	<li>Apple as a leader is putting wireless download into the public eye - a really good thing for the music download industry.</li>
	<li>It puts tremendous pressure on wireless carriers to up their game for music downloads (strategic alignment for us).</li>
	<li>It highlights how difficult it is to find music:  In general it's tough - but on a little hand held - ugh!  Give me some recommendations! Don't give me a top ten or the starbucks favorites!</li>
	<li>It high lights how lousy iTunes actually is for anything other than being a iPod sales tool.</li>
</ol>
I think our wireless strategy addresses an increasing gap in the over-the-air music download space for handheld devices. That gap being - too much music, too little window space, too limited interaction for finding music, and not enough control over the desktop environment.

Oh - and with the prevelence of txting, we have a KILLER way for super distribution to take off. 

Love it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118910051959919525.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">The DOJ just announced it opposes net-neutrality</a>.

As I see it, the two sides of the fence on net-neutrality are: 1. those who believe the Internet is now commerce driven and built (infrastructure wise) on the bottom line and 2. those who believe that the equality of access inherent in today's Internet is more important than commerce. There are those that sit in between the two ends of that spectrum, but I think that captures it. Note that net-neutrality is really about inter-isp charging, not within an ISP, since they do that already (ie: $20/mo for 1.5 mb or $40/mo for 3mb).

I would suggest there are two problems (and I am sure more) with either of these precepts:
<ol>
	<li>I2 is being currently developed and rolled out in the university settings - and universities (in terms of infrastructure development) are not thinking about it from a direct revenue standpoint. This is very similar to when the original Internet rolled out (although that included military - which really isn't thinking about it from a revenue standpoint). When that begins to rollout (or some flavor of it) to the general public, integration into anything other than a net-neutral environment will be a challenge - and immediately affect any company relying on a tiered approach for reveue.</li>
	<li>Traffic is traffic is traffic: There will have to be some kind of serious packet filtering going on to regulate traffic. As soon as you do that - you'll get hackers who work around it. </li>
</ol>
Now - for us there is a third thing: client to client traffic (p2p). Who pays for that? If we move to a tiered charging scheme, that would usually suggest charging businesses for faster connectivity, ie: charging Apple for fast pipes from the iTunes store. But what about bit torrent methodology - where many users contribute to a download?  Do you charge each bit torrent user for using the application? For uploading another couple megabytes of files? I don't think that will fly.

The real problem for a tiered approach for bandwidth in terms of p2p is that the traffic is spread around "in the cloud", it's not centrazlied. Unless you levey a charge on ALL users, then you run into trouble. So - leverage the charge on all users and you're right back to net-neutrality.  Walter, <a href="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/2007/09/03/more-thoughts-on-the-rick-rubin-article/#comment-349">in the comment below</a>, is exactly right - there has to be some type of structure and regulation to it, or else we're going to encounter a total mess.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/ipodtouch.thumbnail.jpg" alt="iPod touch" />Not sure I agree with the <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgets/portablemusic/news/2007/09/wma_apple">assessment that Apple is a monopoly</a>.  While they might currently have the corner on the potable music player market, they hardly have an advantage in any other market. Additionally, their players are just interoperable enough by using the MP3 standard that I doubt they could really be considered anti-competitive. Finally, I really think the iPod is coming the end of an amazing run (over 3 years now) and it can't sustain it...at which point the monoploy question becomes moot.

Of course, it doesn't help us much for them to limit the formats they support, but as long as the iPod plays MP3s, then we're ok.  Ideally Apple would release some kind of API for the iPod to allow for more streamlined integration - but that will never happen.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's almost funny to me that Universal is <a href="http://blog.wired.com/music/2007/08/universals-open.html">moving into watermarking</a>. We approached all the labels in late 2004 with watermarking as an alternate to DRM (which was really MS WM 9 at the time) and they shot it down. 

More accurately, they were open to it and liked it at first (except Sony who had ATRAC at the time and just said forget it), but if we did it, then they wanted us to create bots to scour p2p networks for illegal, watermarked files and report back who had them (we were opposed, but were willing). But then they decided that if we did that, it would probably over burden their already burdened legal departments so they shot it down.

Now it's back again. Sometimes it doesn't pay to have vision.]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Interestingly <a href="http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/stories/091007total">there is talk about a general music charge</a>.  Meaning, when you pay for Internet, you would also be pay an additional charge for downloading music. Think of it like a music tax - like on the phone - when you pay a carrier fee or something. And everyone would have to pay - anyone with Internet access would have to pay.

It's an interesting idea - kind of like the mechanical royalties for radio play. But - fundamentally different.  In the case of radio play, payment is actually tied directly to music plays. In this case, it's not.  As an analogy, it's closer to adding $.05 payment to the music industry per gallon of gas if you happen to go the record store to pick up a free CD.

If it were my business - I would LOVE that. Incredible revenue stream that you don't have to do a whole lot for - and send the accounting to someone else (ie: SoundExchange). 

As a retailer, it would also make rVibe's job easier - we could just blanket it, pay per download and be done.

But it will never fly - the ISPs won't go for it, the regulators won't go for it and consumers won't go for it.  Now - if they made all music, video, and every subscription service free -then it might work.]]></content:encoded>

Which to me makes a lot of sense. More people aware and engaged, but not buying.

If this news doesn't tell you that it's important to offer more services than straight download to keep users sticky, and if it doesn't tell you that more users/less purchase means you have to lower operational infrastructure costs, nothing will.

To me this speaks volumes about retail strategy. You have to have greater ubiquity, non-sales value added services and lower cost to maintain your service in order to be viable. You also have to offer a better mechanism to drive up sales.

And no, I am not just seeing this news through our strategy, it just reveals the value of our company.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/09/the-three-kinds.html">This is great</a> - and exactly where we're going and have been from the beginning.  Note that early on we made the decision to roll our applicaiton out first, but we positioned our architecture as a (level three) platform so we can fairly easily migrate over.  It won't be without its pitfalls, but we're not that far away.  We're already at level 1 and I would never consider level 2 (it just seems like a strange way of doing things). In my view, I want to get rVibe to level three where anyone can leverage any application that runs in our "runtime" to also be exposed via our level one API.  That is going to be way cool.

Where I think Marc misses a little is in the space of configuration. He does touch on it with "easy", but I think it needs extension.  While "programming" will always be fundamental to any computer environment, I suspect that the notion of configuration (controls, IO, data selection &amp; integration, functions and coupling without writing code) is going to be much larger. Such that while configuration may be rather technical, it's far less technical than writing a widget of some sort in [pick your favorite language].  However, to do that and have it be something worth "programming in" is going to be very difficult.

So - couple Level 3 with user configuration of the application and then you have something that can more easily be rolled out, etc. I am not sure we'll get to the level three (configuration model), but we are going to get to level three.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yes, there are definitely <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jdpuDYbDqTXuGoeOKqBnQZ25yccw">many more options</a>from which to choose for music services.  And there are a couple interesting models out there (ie: Spiral Frog, or Aimestreet).  However, there is LOTS of room to grow.

And, as I see it, at the core, these services are still centralized, web-site based services that don't differentiate all that well. Differentiation and value-add are the central keys to success in this market.

I do think that as DRM loosens up, we'll see a spike in sales, however, and for that I am glad.]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have always been fond of higher quality audio files and really dislike compressed audio. The artifacts bother me, the narrow floor and ceiling make classical music almost worthless. CD's are not as warm as analog in general, but I am willing to sacrifice warmth for lack of noise and accuracy. So when you take a CD/.wav file and compress it, you get the worst of all worlds:

Cold audio with noise and no definition.  Delightful.

So - that's why rVibe is offering nothing less than 320kbps MP3 files.  While not perfect, in the compression space, that's about as good as it gets while maintaining interoperability and download-ability.  I do like lossless (ie FLAC or WMA), but they are really too big to download - and you don't have much in the way of real interoperability.

And it's nice to see that <a href="http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20070920005508&amp;newsLang=en">others feel that way too</a>. 

In general, I think that as bandwidth grows faster is available to a more mainstream audience, that the question of file size will decrease and the question of audio quality will increase.  So the more rVibe is associated with higher quality files - and not just whatever anyone wants to throw at it - the better.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/images.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Amazon.com" />Amazon.com <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/blog/post/PLNK1GR94T4PJ38D6/104-8606382-7463951?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-7&amp;pf_rd_r=1B1485KJ1WHJWC29VYD4&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=249703901&amp;pf_rd_i=5174">launched it's MP3 store today</a>...   This is a pretty big deal for a number of reasons and has meaning for rVibe as well. The reason it's a big deal is:
<ol>
	<li><strong>They only sell MP3 files: </strong>That means no DRM, and means total interoperability for all the tracks it sells. With Amazon.com's clout, that is a HUGE advancement for the on-line music industry. It put tremendous pressure on the rest of the labels out there to allow DRM free tracks, and on the rest of the labels out there to get it together and start offering digital music. They don't have the 5 million tracks that iTunes, does, but I am sure they will soon.</li>
	<li><strong>Fantastic branding and awareness:</strong>Amazon is launching into a rapidly expanding market with an already enormous brand presence. That dramatically reduces barrier to adoption for new users. And more specifically, Amazon has a reputation for being easy to use.  Not customer service oriented, but definitely easy to use.</li>
	<li><strong>Existing infrastructure:</strong> From an operational standpoint, they already have a strong infrastructure to support pure digital delivery. There would be little in the way of operational investment to get this going, sustain it and make it profitable.  That is highly unusual in this industry.</li>
</ol>
For rVibe, Amazon.com's launch is both good and bad.

From a bad standpoint:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Competition:</strong> Greater competition from a large, well capitalized company that clearly wants to (and can) take on the entrenched major player (Apple).  That means a fierce fight for consumer eyes and that's tough for us, since we need a lot of those same eyes. </li>
	<li><strong>Noise in the market place:</strong>  The launch will generate a lot of noise in the market place which makes it difficult to launch a new product (rVibe).</li>
	<li><strong>Some similar features: </strong>Their service is MP3 only (as is rVibe), they have recommendations (as does rVibe) and it's easy to use (as is rVibe).</li>
	<li><strong>Capitalization:</strong>  They have lots of money and we don't. See above for why that's a problem.</li>
</ol>
From the good standpoint
<ol>
	<li><strong>It's amazon.com - not something else:</strong>  Meaning, when you buy tracks from amazon.com, you expect it to behave like amazon.com, not something different. That means that they really can't change their basic means of operating, which gives innovative services (like rVibe) a chance to shine when people want something else (like embedded social networking in their music service).</li>
	<li><strong>It' still the centralized model and subject to bandwidth and storage costs:</strong>  Despite Amazon's infrastructure, they still have to pay for things and with much usage comes much cost.  Cost rVibe really doesn't have.</li>
	<li><strong>More visibility for on-line music and MP3 downloads: </strong> The more Amazon presses the MP3 button and builds awareness in the overall market for digital downloads and MP3 only - the less work we have to do to educate the consumer.</li>
</ol>
I am quite sure there are lots of things I am missing, but it's a start in thinking about it.  As is always the case, in this nascent but exploding market, the real key is DIFFERENTIATION.  And even with Amazon.com's launch, we still have that as a strength.]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/virgindigital.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Virgin Digital" />Well - <a href="http://news.digitaltrends.com/news/story/14266/virgin_digital_exits_music_business">Virgin Digital is done selling music online</a>. They have transferred all their customer stuff to Napster.

When a customer focused, value add focused, cash flush company exits a market so quickly and quietly, it makes you wonder why. There are not that many reasons:
<ol>
	<li><strong>It was hemorrhaging money:</strong> But I think not enough of a reason in this case.</li>
	<li><strong>Outside core value offering:</strong>  Definitely think this is a good reason for Virgin Digital to exit this market.</li>
	<li><strong>Outside company strategy:</strong> Reasonable, but not for such a quick exit.</li>
	<li><strong>New strategy in place:</strong> And not compatible with existing strategy.  Very reasonable - and I think the most likely.</li>
	<li><strong>Exec hated and killed it:</strong>  It happens, and could be related to any of the above.</li>
</ol>
So - if I am right about number 4 - that Virgin has a new strategy in place that is not compatible with the existing service, then what could that service be?  Here's what I could imagine:

<strong>Virgin Mobile music download service.</strong>  A la carte downloads directly to your phone. Much like Verizon vCast. The open question there is: Would this be enough to draw new users to their service, or do will they need and do further differentiation?

We'll see. I give it 6-9 months before they roll out a new service under a different corporate banner.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As an early stage company founder and CEO, I am obsessed with money management. Meaning - I have the perpetual sense that we're about to run out of it. Sometimes we are, sometimes we're not, but it definitely keeps my paranoid mind alert (at night).

I think that bootstrapping (which is what we've done) has a very profound effect on the culture of a company. It creates a mind-set of "essentiality", not excess. It creates a mind-set of how much we can get done on how little. It's a mind set of really appreciating reward when it comes. And I think from a pure business perspective, it creates a mind-set of operational efficiency that results in higher margins.

I wonder what percentage of web 1.0 companies that made it through the long winter were bootstrapped companies.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In keeping with the $ and essentiality theme, in a pre-revenue early stage company it's fun to think about future earnings.  By 'fun' I mean a thrill (thinking about the huge amounts of money we're going to make), and sheer terror (thinking about how we are never going to make any money).  The normal roller coaster. Oh - and what that implies for your company in either scenario on the spectrum.

But from a pro forma standpoint, the thing that I struggle with the most - is the assumed relationship between sales/marketing activities and revenue.  Not normal operating costs (ie: rent), but money you need to apply to programs to help drive revenue. Here's what I mean:

It's often believed that the more money you throw at a marketing or sales program the higher revenue you will have.  Believing this notion is often independent of having decent product, although there may be an inverse relationship - the better your product, the less you spend on marketing, the worse, the more you spend (but I am pretty sure that's irrelevant).  I think in general people believe that marketing dollars should be spent in relation to the amount of competition in the segment. Resulting in: if you spend x on marketing, you will get y in revenue.

One of the measures used I often hear (that illustrates the segment angle and the overall spend assumptions) is determining percentage of marketing dollars to revenue. Example: Yahoo marketing spend was 45% of sales in 2002, or Napster's marketing spend was 80% of revenue in 2004.  But does this mean that the marketing dollars spent resulted in the revenue earned?  Could be, but maybe not. What if those are loyal/repeat customers - then does it apply?

I think the assumption that by putting money into a marketing you will <em>necessarily </em>drive an increase sales is not accurate. I think there is a correlation, but it's not correct to assume causality. And if it's not - from a pro forma calculation standpoint, how do you determine sales and what does an investment do to drive sales?

This issue is ultimately one of the key problems with pro-formas and why valuations are such a dark art.

Here's our solution:  Base your pro formas on expected customer spend habits (either retail purchase, or CPM/click through) and determine what it costs to acquire those customers. So - if you can assume that you keep a customer for a period of time, and that customer will <em>on average</em> spend a certain amount, then you can determine your revenue fairly accurately based on the number of customers you have.

Then the real trick becomes determining customer acquisition cost (and that's where the marketing dollars are important).  You need to both answer the question of what does is cost per customer to acquire and what does it cost to keep them.  Ideally your cost to keep is lower and ideally as you build a customer base your cost to acquire is lower.  

The notion of customer acquisition cost is not new of course. And it's why viral is such a big deal: viral effectively reduces the cost of customer acquisition to zero.  That's obviously important when you consider that in the early days AOL was spending something like $300 per customer acquisition. And it's obviously important when you think of profit margin. And it's critical when you are bootstrapping.

Now sadly, I don't believe viral marketing is the right assumption to make for determine marketing spend to revenue. You can't assume $0 cost for marketing. But I do think you can incentivize and facilitate viral expansion and get fairly close to an accurate read on cost per customer acquisition.  However, to be really accurate you need to have a little data from experience. In rVibe's case - when we launch and start collecting data on our viral program conversion rates, we should be to do much much more accurate assessment of our projected acquisition costs.

And lastly, customer acquisition means nothing if you don't have a revenue model and don't know what people spend in that model. By nothing I mean "it will run your business in to the ground quickly." Again, in our space, since there have been a number of surveys done in our space about average customer spend, we should be able to somewhat reasonably determine projected revenue. Once we have actual numbers we can work on driving that up (spend marketing $ to both keep existing customers and drive their spend up).

We'll see (that's what you always have to say after these discussions).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" width="96" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/images.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Amazon.com" height="93" />Amazon.com's launch is ALL OVER the news and blogosphere. It would have been a disaster to launch rVibe in the middle of that. 

We're going to have to wait until at least next week to launch.

And all I can say is that thank goodness the Apple backlash is starting to gain some momentum - this really really bodes well for loosening up and growing the market.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Business is a series of human interactions. Even the world of economics is nothing more than human designed interactions. To know that all you have to do is remove humans from the equation. When you do, both business and economics disappear. I particularly love that economics disappears since so many people seem to think it's a system of immutable laws that govern the world in which we live. To me that's funny. But to paraphrase, I suppose if we believe in the social structures they are real in their consequences.

All that said, I believe that almost all business interaction is based on trust. Whether that is between companies, groups, or individuals. But by trust I don't actually mean hoping your partner will do the right thing by you. What I mean is that your partner is consistent in their behavior - predictable. That day in and day out they will interact and deliver and respond consistently.

I think it's critical that when you pick a partner, you trust your partners. That everyday you know exactly how they will behave in an interaction. Maybe that means they are going to try and short change you, or steal an idea, or offer generously of their ideas and energy. In any case you MUST know how they will react in any given situation or you can not manage your strategy. You can apply this to competitors or business friends.

And to trust requires listening and understanding. That's where you start in a partnership and proceed with openness. That makes the business of human interaction work.

We're also working on some other deals with them that we're excited about - but don't want to spill the beans on... More to come soon.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.lehigh.edu/~incbeug/faculty/DaleFalcinelli.htm">Dale Falcinelli</a> asked me to speak at his vSeries at Lehigh to discuss our IP strategy; he thinks what we're doing (IP wise) is really interesting. At first I thought he was joking and making fun, I mean - we have IP - so what???  Then I realized he's looking at it from the Entrepreneur's perspective. He wants to give his MBA students a chance to peer inside a fairly dynamic and innovative company in an interesting space.

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I often remark on the poor quality of digital audio; it drives me nuts.  Having been in the live music world and the digital world, I have always had a hard time with poor audio quality.  There is something profound that happens with sitting inside, or directly in front of an orchestra, or any large, non-amplified band (rock bands are fine, but when you sit 5 feet from 90 musicians playing Beethoven, there is a big difference). The hush of bows on strings, the click of clarinet keys, the slight breath before a horn blast - the acoustic vibration of the intervals as they pulse around you the lushness of a fully balanced and blended sounds that engulfs you; the sense of people making the music - of sharing in that. Incredible - trans-formative - and completely engaged.  Unfortunately recorded music can't beat it. Maybe one day, I don't know - but not right now. And digital music and compression of digital music just further reduces the musical experience.  

Wired has a <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/news/2007/10/bose_qa">great interview</a> with the founder of <a href="http://bose.com/">Bose</a>, Amar Bose about the quality of recorded audio and the state of digital audio reproduction.  Here is the comment I like best:
<blockquote><em> </em><em>I bought a violin record to play [...] and said, "Oh my gosh, that is nothing like the way real music sounds."</em></blockquote>
'nuff said. If don't agree, then you've never actually been around live music or actually listened to it. 

But here is the comment I find most meaningful for online distribution of digital music:
<blockquote><em>Sadly, there's a heck of a lot of emphasis on people developing gadgets to get to market quickly, which have incredible troubles interconnecting to other gadgets. You are in the stage that hi-fi audio was in the 1950s, with so many systems that the consumer is confounded by the complexity and doesn't care to know. They care to use the thing, not to know how in the heck to connect it to this and that. However, I do believe that will pass, as it did with hi-fi.</em></blockquote>
And what he means in terms of audio quality is that it suffers - greatly - in the name of time to market.  Note I did not say commerce. I actually believe (contrary to what many people believe) that consumers want higher quality products. They want products cheap, but they will always prefer higher quality over lower quality. And this goes for audio as well. If a consumer can get better audio at the same price/cost, they will always choose the better quality. But in the race to time to market (and honestly, we're not that different) we skip over audio quality.

So, I think that while we're not near to recreating the live experience, we can at least offer consumers better quality at the same price. There is an additional cost - longer download times, but we're talking about a couple minutes. We're banking that users will wait - so we're offering files in 320kbps MP3 format.  Not great, but far better than 128 or even 256.]]></content:encoded>

In point 2 you make - I would consider the recording a musical expereince unto itself - it's not so much a reproduction of an event as the event itself that you are engaged in.  Maybe it's better to take a more meta approach and say that typically recorded music disengages us from the musical experience, unless the recording <i>is</i> the musical experience.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[A couple of thoughts on this, Braydon:

1) For some cases, your point is spot on (I saw the Boston Symphony doing Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra a few years back. I know this piece forwards and backwards from some excellent recordings. Sitting in a well-designed concert hall with a great orchestra I was amazed to see that there were things in the music that I had literally never heard before -- they were only audible as a result of the spatial separation of the musicians; when collapsed to a stereo recording, there were internal features that were completely masked).

2) In other cases, I have to disagree completely (which shouldn't surprise you). Other than the spectacle of seeing a band live (which I can only discount to a certain extent), I'd far rather listen to (as an example) a Steely Dan recording that was engineered by Roger Nichols played back on mediocre equipment than hear them play live in an outdoor ampitheater (which I've done a couple of times). 

3) This stuff is all really new. The first multitrack digital recorders are less than 30 years old. MPEG audio encoding is less than 15 years old. This is like saying that Edison wax cylinders don't exhibit perfect fidelity.]]></wp:comment_content>

Over the next month we'll both be incorporating changes from user feedback as well as beginning to implement improvements to the platform as we point to 2.0.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have always deplored redundancy and inefficiency - it makes me crazy.  It makes my wife crazy that I am so nuts about it - she would rather just have me repeat doing something that have me fuss about it.  But fuss I do.

And now we've built an application that has redundant data in it. I am referring to the information about myself in my profile. It's some of the same fields that are found in MySpace and Facebook and any number of applications. It drives me crazy that we've done that.  But the thing is - these are fields you have to have. You can't really have a social networking application with out areas for people to personalize it - it just doesn't work. 

In my view it's a kind of no win proposition for any social network:  tick off your users by making them repeatedly input information about them selves, or tick them off by not allowing them to customize. OpenID might be a way to make it work - but it's still a ways off.  We're exploring putting OpenID into place for rVibe, but I'm not sure. 

A nice application would be an identity service that you filled in once - call it 'extensis'. On any social network (rVibe included), you could just say "fill in from my 'extensis' profile."  Once and one.  Extensis would have to have an api that was consumed by many social net apps, which would mean it needs to have an existing user base.  To get there is might need to have a "reverse screen scraping" component to input data into your various networks. I don't know.

But I'd be willing to explore embedding something like that into rVibe.]]></content:encoded>

There is a good <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/about/news/2007/10/oauth_share_you.html" rel="nofollow">post over at SixApart</a> talking about these two protocols.  

If you have any questions about <a href="https://pibb.com/go/OpenID" rel="nofollow">OpenID</a> or <a href="https://pibb.com/go/OAuth" rel="nofollow">OAuth,/a&gt; there are dedicated channels on <a href="https://pibb.com/pibb" rel="nofollow">Pibb</a> where you can communicate directly with the developers.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since our launch on Wednesday we've had a pretty strong response - and we're starting to see a performance hit (naturally).  So - we're upgrading to a much more powerful server environment. We should have that done pretty soon and I expect to see a pretty dramatic improvement in performance.

Thank you for being patient!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I really never knew much about Roman history; just never did, wasn't terribly interested in it. Then I read somewhere (I can't remember where) that sometimes we in western civilization are not able to see past our Greek and Roman influenced thinking and come to any real new understanding or paradigm.  The idea being that the foundation of western thought is so grounded in Geek and Roman thinking and our framework for operating is so deeply constructed from the structures put together in those civilizations, that we have not flexed much from that time (yes, lots has changed, but I am talking about fundamental perspectives on the world - like oligarchy, or bivalent logic). So I became more interested.  Not so interested that I want to read a ton of Greek and Roman history, but curious in general - I am particularly interested in limitation of thought due to embedded assumptions. So I picked up Anthony Everitt's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cicero-Times-Romes-Greatest-Politician/dp/037575895X">Cicero: Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician</a>.

Everitt provides a great and searing view of Rome's heyday with Cicero at the center. It's an engaging read with tons of thoughts on the political machinations of the time. The book is almost a better Roman political evaluation that a biography, but Cicero is clearly at the center. Here's a politician who had no army (you really had to have an army to be someone in those days), yet took on Caesar and nearly won. His oratorical skills were unbelievable and his political strategy, ruthless. If you want to understand what divide and conquer means, look to Cicero. If you want to know how to play two ends against the middle, look at Cicero. He could and did it all.

Now, I am not saying I like the guy, but he sure could politic like no body else. And this is where that assertion of more things change the more they stay the same comes in:  We are doing the exact same stuff today in our politics they were doing back then. Scandal, intrigue, tear down people reputations, picket them, etc. We just don't have stabbings in the senate or have our senators' throats slit.

I really enjoyed Everitt's book - it was well thought out, well presented and engaging. It gave me insight into Rome's politics as well as modern day politics and our own framework for operating - and to me that is a great combination to have.

Now, if I can get the same type of thing for Asia, that would be great.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just finishing up a CFO/COO review of our company. That means we had an external consultant come in and tell us all the things that are wrong with how we manage our financial and operations house. Verdict: Not bad at all! What a nice find. We had some gaps in our GAAP accounting on transactions that we've corrected for and we needed to modify the operating agreement to reduce the voting power of the founder a little; doing that soon.

I think it's invaluable to have some external review from time to time.  Even with the smartest people around you - when you get accustomed to how you do things, it's sometimes hard to identify your problem areas and a fresh set of eyes is a great way to do that.

We also had the team look at our <em>pro formas</em> and growth assumptions (both cost and revenue) and help us remodel our projections. Verdict - not bad at all (and that means really good). Love that too.

Next is overhauling the business plan. It used to be a fundraising plan, now it's more of an operational plan and a way for us to judge our progress.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well - we've starting pitching to VC's and early stage investors in earnest now.  One week ago we did a round with an early stage Angel fund, yesterday we did an on-line demo to a growth stage VC firm (not a good match - yet), we have four VCs getting lined up for the next two weeks, and six more we're dancing with to see if we should talk more.

Working toward finding the right partner - and a term sheet!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Phew - that's done. We're tuning it now - but performance is also better just as is.  We're also moving the scanning process out of the main process to improve application responsiveness at the outset. 

It's a never ending struggle to balance fixes and enhancements with net new functionality. Right now net new has taken a two week backseat (kind of - we've made huge progress on the UI model classes), but we should see a WHOLE BUNCH of great stuff come on line over the next three weeks or so.

Things to watch for:
<ol>
	<li>Embeddable playlists for blogs and website (with eCommerce functionality)</li>
	<li>Radio format listening for friends, recommendations and other stuff</li>
	<li>Flyout menus for reducing number of clicks to do <em>things</em></li>
</ol>
General stability and data cleansing as well.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[MusicIP has just released their new <a href="http://www.musicip.com/reporting">reporting stuff</a> and it's very cool.  I chatted with Adam over there and we're going to see what we can do to move some of their new analytics into rVibe. I see it as an ad delivery play, they see it a little differently, but interested in exploring how our use of it might develop their focus.  That is partnership - benefit to everyone - and I love it. ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[WMG is the latest major label to start backing out of their iTunes agreement and it certainly seems the backlash continues. But I wonder... the major labels definitely follow one another as they move into new territory (latest example is DRM free music - EMI went first), but I am not sure they follow one another when they back out of something like iTunes (as much as they don't like it).

So it makes me wonder if there is a different force at work - prep for a new direction. I don't think that new direction is the 'total music' thing, but there could be more.

Universal licensing for all content? We could only be so lucky.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.emi.com"><img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/emilogo.thumbnail.gif" alt="EMI" /></a>In 2004, we approached Warner and EMI about using watermarking for rVibe as a means to protect content while permitting interoperability of file types. In principle they did not have a problem with watermarks, they just felt that there was not enough control.  They suggested that if we also built a bot to scour p2p networks and report back on illegal files found that originated from our systems, that they might consider using it.  Then they decided not to at all.

Now, <a href="http://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/news/2008/01/sony_music">reports are coming in</a> that watermarking is back and might be making in-roads. 

Some times it does not actually pay to be ahead of the curve.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We're actively raising institutional money to come out of seed-stage and really get rolling. It's pretty exciting, but lots of work as well. In attempting to be as efficient as possible, we're prepping our due diligence materials in advance as much as possible. Our goal: on initiation of DD, to be able to turn around all materials as quickly as possible.

To prep, here are some of the things we're doing:
<ol>
	<li>
<div>Scanning to PDF all contracts, agreements (ie: ops/shares agreements), IP and pertinent financial materials (ie: Tax returns)</div>
</li>
	<li>
<div>Having out accountants perform audits on all our financials</div>
</li>
	<li>
<div>Updating and maintaining pro formas</div>
</li>
	<li>
<div>Status on technology and customer base</div>
</li>
	<li>
<div>Business plans, marketing materials, and strategic docs</div>
</li>
</ol>
We have almost all of it in soft copy now, but need to document in a consolidated format for consistency. The thing that's going to take the longest is the audited financials. We're meeting with our accountants on Wednesday to go through the how/what/when/where/cost of an audit.]]></content:encoded>

Although the cuts are hard for everyone of course (and not just for the folks being cut), there seems to be some strong positive direction in the new strategy outlined.  Most notably are the focus on A&amp;R as well as the emphasis on making digital a more comprehensive channel (as opposed to a hacked together group for licensing). 

I am thrilled that EMI is taking such a strong lead on working through their longer term strategy for growth and looking at innovative organizational structures to make it a reality.

However, I do worry that the net effect is a step backwards on the licensing front - even if it's only a six months - any lag is a long time in this environment.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.rvibe.com" title="rVibe"><img align="right" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/logo.thumbnail.jpg" alt="rVibe logo" /></a>Definitions on the status of companies change pretty regularly and early on there seems to be some confusion around what is seed and what is early stage.   Here's my take:

<strong>Seed stage:</strong>  When a company has just formed, has the beginnings (or even early complete) business plan, an incomplete team and is developing a prototype of a product.  They have a solid idea of the market and customers, but have not begun to fully access it. They probably don't have a full team, they probably have not really started to market their product.   They have raised some money - enough to do all of the above.  They've been doing all this long enough (btw - a month is not long enough) to show some resiliency and some maturity.

To exit seed stage, the company should have a functioning prototype (maybe a beta version of the software) that is starting to be vetted by real customers, they might even have a customer or two (depending on market) and the business plan is getting more solid.  They may have revenue (ideally they do), but may not.

<strong>Early stage:</strong> When a company has a beta version of the product that is starting to be picked up by customers and the company is positioned to begin growing revenue. The team may not be complete, but the strategy is beginning to mature. The company may have some revenue, but more likely is positioned to quickly grow revenue with proper support.  Marketing is underway, but has not reached a critical mass.

To exit early stage, the company (depending on market environment), most metrics will point to revenue - typically in the $5m/annual range.

<strong>So -</strong>  based on that definition (which I think is pretty reasonable), rVibe is just exiting seed stage.  We've had strong support and good, solid seed investment, and now we're in a position to really start growing. It's just a question of the capital and support to go to the next level.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yes, I know, the Apple Keynote big ticket items are the Air and Video rentals.  Ok - that's fine.  But for me I liked the iTunes music sales part.  They have sold 4 billion songs, and 20 million in one day. Despite the fact that iTunes is really all about selling iPods, here is the quote I like the best:
<blockquote><em>"We've never offered a rental model in music because we don't think people don't want to rent music."</em></blockquote>
We wholeheartedly agree. I believe that both the subscription model and the free model are not permanent solutions and are not solutions that people really want.  Some think it's naive to say that people want to buy music, but it's actually true.  And you really need look no further than 4 billion downloads to answer that.

The real question for us (and the rest of the industry) is how to create a compelling enough experience that people want to pay for music. iTunes has done that by coupling it to the iPod family.  For stand alone services, the value will have to be something else, but it's exceptionally clear that:
<ol>
	<li>
<div>When the value is high, people will pay and return</div>
</li>
	<li>
<div>When the value is moderate, people will pay temporarily (ie Napster) and leave</div>
</li>
	<li>
<div>When the product is free, people will use it, but loyalty is low</div>
</li>
</ol>
I get a lot of "How will you compete with Apple? How will you compete with Free?"  In a dramatically expanding market, I think the better question is:  "How will you add value to the customer so that they want to pay for music?" And I think we have the answer:  Context.

<a href="http://www.fistfulayen.com/blog/?p=147">Ian Rogers</a> and I are on the same page - you have to provide an environment where scale rules and where context provides the impetus for sales.  Meaning - if you provide meaningful and rich context around content and a low barrier to accessing that content, then sales will take place.

In our case, the challenge is in generating enough critical mass such that the meaningful content arises from our users.  And critical mass just takes a little time.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In our quest for extending the range of our partnerships, an interesting dropped out of the sky yesterday.  

I've been chatting with a company about various things and they brought up an idea they would like to explore doing with us. This is an American company that works in music reporduction.  Without divulging too much, we're going to look at delivery of live music.  It's someting that is new and very coool and I think we'd be a good match.

More to come.... ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Our business is about providing an arena for people to easily share music, manage music, make friends, buy music and deliver advertising. Our revenue model is collecting fees from music merchandising and advertising delivery.

But we're now faced with an interesting change in direction.  Or at least an addition to our world.  From a consumer's and advertiser's view this change would represent an enhancement in our exisiting 'complete music service' framework, but there is a lot behind the scenes that would have to happen.

On the upside, we're exploring a fairly new direction in music delivery that would give us greater differentiation and significantly greater revenue.  The down side is that it's going to take 'initiative' money to get it up and running.

By partnering we should be able to accomplish it, and I hope we do.  I think it's a pretty amazing opportnity we're looking at.

The challenge is that we don't have significant growth at the moment and have not hammered out all our bugs in our current platform just yet.  We're going to have to balance our in-flight operations (which have not fully operationalized) with this new work.  A pretty common occurance in the world of business, but not one that happens in start-ups as much as it does in large corporations.

For me the management is not the issue, the capital is.  And that is very common in a start-up. I am confident we can handle integrating a new business, so now we need to look at how to fund building it.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, I am sitting here in the airport waiting for my delayed flight and thinking about our competition, their offerings versus our offerings and thinking about how jump ahead in the offering space. 

I don't mean to say that our business model needs to be improved.  There are lots of people who believe that streaming is the future and who believe that music will eventually come from 'within the cloud'.  If we ever get there, I think it's going to be a while. Here's why: 

1 there are too many concerns about bandwidth usgae and serivce providers attempting to drive margins higher by charging premium pricing for bandwidth usage.  They want to drive out as much cost as possible (despite Verizon rolling out fios).

2 file compression is not improving; but people's preference for higher qualiy files is improving. Meaning, file sizes, and more importantly (for streaming), bit depths are larger.  Right now, the pipe to the home is just too small and too shaed to reliably stream  higher bit files without a lot of buffering.  And the files are only going to get bigger.  If we want to get to cd quality, or surround sound, or sacd, forget it.   And to upgrade that existing pipe costs moeny - see one above.  

3. Storage is getting cheaper faster than bandwidth.  While that holds true, and we see greater amounts of storage on smaller and smaller devices, and 2 above holds true, then wholesale streaming is not going to be the way people consume music.

4. music is an owned commodity.  The moment Petrucci rolled off the first shee music for sale it was all over.  People own music.  They take it home; it is theirs.  600 years of ingrained behavior around music ownership.  

So, we're sticking with music downloads as a business model.  We're hedging a bit by adding radio streaming and pay per stream - oh and btw - for the $3/mo for last.fm subscription you could stream about 120 songs on rVibe and then buy them for a discount - not a full priced affiliate sale.

Ok, but about the offering?  So far in the market we see these types of services:
1. a la carte downloads of songs (iTunes, Amazon, rVibe) using client or website
2. Subscription services for downloading (Rhapsody) in web and client format
3. Subscription services for streaming (last.fm) 
4. Ad supported services for downloading (spiralfrog)
5. Ad supported services for streaming (imeem)
6. a la carte streaming (rVibe)
7. Legally questionable mp3 search and play services (seeqpod)
8. Free streaming (radio) services (jango, pandora)

And across these sites/services we see these primary content presentation models - retail storefront, jukebox players, playlist sharing, programmatic recommendation/playlisting engines and social networking (to various degrees).  

But here is the thing(s) - everyone is selling the exact same 3-5 million tracks (with minor exceptions on 'exclusive' contnet). And these tracks are all pre-recorded and produced to one degree or another. So at this point the differentiation is not about the content being served, it's about the access methodology.  To me this is why it's painfully clear that this market is really in it's infancy.  There is still a ton of content that is missing - the offerings today are not musically comprehensive in any way.

What about live music?
What about rehersals?
What about composing/songwriting?
What about theater?
What about instruction?
What about international?
What about festivals?

that's the content....

what about the context?  other than rudimentary playlist sharing, neighbor radio and some facebook work, music on the internet has no real context.  

What does it mean to me?
Why do I listen?
When do I listen?
How do I listen (passive/active)
How do I interact with other people in the music space?

These basic questions are not even being asked (with the exception of 'how often' ie scrobbing), let alone given into a context that gives the user any value or meaning.

So - those are the questions that are driving me to expand our offering.  I am super excited to provide more content, context and meaning for our rVibe family.

And here, as I look out in the word, while I think there are clearly far more than two types of people, I think that people tend to look a the world in one of two ways and therefore, since people run companies, and companies have a culture created by people, companies tend to look at the world in one of two ways:

They either see (and act on) the potential in things, or they see (and act on) the performance of things.  In the former - where people see the potential in things - they (and the companies run by these kinds of people) tend to look at "a something" and ask "what will it do?", where in the latter group, people tend to ask "what has it done?" And they act accordingly.

And I also believe that these two groups have risk profiles.  Meaning, the first group - the "potential" group tends to have a higher risk tolerance and the second group, the "performance" group, tends to have a lower risk tolerance.

So - in this bivalent view of the world, the result is this: group one tends to look at the startup space and is enthused by it. They tend to look at cool products and want to use them - and then extend them. And engage in it all. The other group looks at the startup space and tends to shy away, it's just not as engaging for them.

In terms of company hiring and promotion, I think this is true as well.  The first group, the potential group, the higher risk tolerance group, tends to hire based on where the person will go (with some experience of course) and tends to promote into a position above where the person is today.  The second group tends to hire based on past experience and promotes after a new role has been accomplished.  Both have their pros and cons.

And I believe that venture and angel investment takes this view as well.  If you are an investor who looks at the potential in things, then you are more likely to invest in the potential and be willing to absorb the risk of performance. If you are an investor who looks at the performance, you are looking at the track record above other criteria.

I tend to look at the potential.  I like to see experience, but I like to see the enthusiasm of engagement and potential more than experience. ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In our fund-raising quest, I just pitched to the <a href="http://www.newyorkangels.com/">NY Angels</a> investment group. The pitch went very well:  there were three screening members, one of whom clearly was familiar with the space and technology, and the other two extremely sharp on understanding the business.  They were engaged, asked good questions and really got it. And I am super happy to say - they really got the differentiation - I think our message is starting to really clarify, which is great.

So - who really knows with these things - I've done this enough now to realize that there are so many factors at play that have nothing to do with us - but all in all, a good pitch was had by all.

They'll let us know Monday if we get invited to the breakfast.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, statistics-wise it was likely to happen - the NY Angels group passed on pursuing an investment in rVibe. Their rationale is one we hear about the space in general:  too competitive, too hard to compete against iTunes.

This type of feedback is common for investors who are not familiar with the space.  While it's true that online music/social networks markets are crowded, and it's not an "easy" market to enter, there are a lot of "me too" services out there - and we believe there is a lot of opportunity for a well differentiated service - which we have.

So, we keep on it - we have a number of other investor screenings lined up over the next two months.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We've been doing a ton of work to get a better sense of our differentiators and value add to our users.  Over and over again, our focus on giving back comes up. Thus, our language and message is changing to drive more about our charity partners - and over time our functionality will change too.

In addition, we're making it clearer around "what you do when you use rVibe" so when members start up, they can get rolling faster:
<ol>
	<li>
<div>Manage your own music on your computer better than before</div>
</li>
	<li>
<div>Share and buy music from your friends, or from rVibe - get rewards</div>
</li>
	<li>
<div>Give your rewards to one of our charity partners - we work better together</div>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We continue with our fundraising activity - and as any CEO will tell you - it's a combination of super dedication, preparation, and recovery from rejection.  And in each rejection, you make a stronger, better case.  And I think ours is very strong now - and getting stronger all the time.

And this is proved out by the responses we get from investors and how the tone is changing over time. Meaning, in the early days it was clear that we were too early, too under developed, and not mature enough.  That has long since changed, and now the questions are now more investment oriented - risk, risk, risk - competition, capital uses and validity of our pro forma (ie: is our unique view cost too high on our ad delivery such that our projections are not realistic - which - we're fine there).  So - it's a good story today.

When I met with a potential investor today and he said our next steps slide was exactly what he wanted to see and will use it as an example of how to do a next steps/fund use slide - I knew we're come a long way.

Now we keep at it of course.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the greatest things about a small company and even better about a startup is the ability to change strategic direction - quickly.  Unlike larger corporations with large investments in human capital and infrastructure, a nimble startup can identify opportunities and action them fast. Of course, a large company typically has greater resources at their disposal, but also when there are greater resources, there is often less hunger. 

So - I think what that means is that smaller can be (but does not have to be) more nimble, and companies that are hungrier will move on opportunities.  Of course, being nimble and moving doesn't do much good unless there is a vision to align to - you can't just start swinging. When you have limited resources, you have to be smart.  And that's where good leadership comes in:  being receptive to new ideas and new ways to do business, allocating limited resources effectively and moving quickly to maximize on delivery.

That's all pretty basic strategy stuff of course, fine.  But getting to that point takes something else. Courage and inspiration.  Courage to follow your note and inspiration to get others to follow your lead.  Change does not come easily to groups, and you have to make sure everyone is on the same page.  

All this is to say - that's what we're doing right now.  We recognize that while rVibe is pretty well differentiated in terms functions, look/feel, benefits; we need to also differentiate further to be really successful.  Thus, we're adding a segment to our business.  We were approached with an opportunity, we maximized that relationship, we extended it and started developing additional partners and we're moving.

We'll be able to announce more about our direction pretty soon - but suffice it to say - it's both a new business that very very few others are doing - and no body like where we're headed, as well a great fit into the rVibe ecosystem for music delivery.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["Free streaming" services are popping up by the hand-full.  Qtrax and Spiralfrog are attempting to line up labels and get their "free download" services off the ground. There is a problem with ad-supported, and I don't just mean it's not cost effective for businesses.

From the consumer's view, the music is not really free, it's really ad supported.  Which means that you have to either hear or view ads to experience the music.  So - let's not call it free - let's call it ad-view supported.  The consumer has to experience ads in order to experience music. For radio streaming - where you're fed a playlist that you don't control - that's not necessarily a bad thing - radio has done it for a long time and quite successfully (until now anyway).  Dropping in an ad here and there has not deterred people from switching on the radio to experience music.  But I think when you choose the track you want and when you want to "own" that track, it is not a really viable model.  It's all a question of what people think of as ownership.

And I think it's pretty clear people do not want advertisers slapping ads on things they think they own.  Now - people might do that them selves (think the words "GAP" on any gap t shirt that people buy), but they don't want it done to them.  For a couple examples - when a company gives you a free T shirt with their logo, you may or may not wear it (ie: OfficeMax)- but it's not likely to become one of your staples.  Hmm - but the analogy breaks down - a t shirt is something you have - but it's not really an experience, where music is an experience.

People don't want advertisers inserting an ad into something that people own - that is experience based.  Think owning a car - if an advertiser (again like officemax) offered to give you a car painted with an officemax logo would you want it?  But wait - there is a better example - think going to a psychologist (any many people think of music as therapeutic); that is a relationship that the patient feels they own.  Now - do you think people would stand for it if every time the therapist opened their mouth to say something an ad came out first?  I kinda doubt it. They would rather pay for the experience than go through that.

Hence the reason that paid downloads are booming.  It's just so simple - make all music available for download and give users a fun and easy way to get music they know they want, find music they will like, experience and manage their music in a way that works for them, and allow them to incorporate music into their social world.

I suppose people will try out Qtrax for a while, and some people will stick with it.  But at the end of the day, I don't think it's going to be a large segment of the music business - it's just not they way people want to experience music.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When thinking about anything that has any kind of process around it, I generally take the stance of:  the process around something serves a purpose in some capacity;  it may not be a process that serves me well and my engaging in the process may not feel efficient or nice, but the process is efficient for some entity with some purpose. And that process ALWAYS serves the purpose of the one in power.

You can actually apply this thinking to pretty much anything: customer service, purchasing, government, institutional, Disney World.  My current favorite example is TSA security in the airport.  People whine and complain about it - and I do too - I can't stand it. But, it serves someone/something quite well - you just have to understand it.  Meaning - even with multiple checkpoints, the process is very sequential and single threaded; it's very cumbersome and labor intensive (for everyone -consumer and provider). This is really a pain for the traveller. BUT - it's great for someone.

That someone, has an intent, a message and a purpose. I am not sure I can causally identify the real root of all that for TSA, but here it goes:  If we assume that the purpose of the security check points (in addition to actually checking for terrorists) is to demonstrate control over the environment, demonstrate commitment via the number of people engaged, delay people to remind them of the importance of security and humiliate (minor humiliation) people so they feel a bit out of control them selves (and further the notion that the TSA is <em>in</em> control), then the process of security checkpoints a airports is marvelous. It serves that purpose perfectly. <em>Disclaimer: I am not saying that is the purpose but the process maps to the results.</em>

The same process thinking can be applied to purchase paths on websites. If the intent of CNN was to have people actually buy something - it would be a disaster of a design.  If the intent of Amazon.com was social-networking - it would be a bad design.  However, for Amazon's, the intent is to make it easy to find something to buy and easy to make that purchase.  In this case, the process serves that goal.  I mentioned that the process serves the one in power - think of LL Bean or Amazon.  Great customer service - easy to execute a purchase, etc etc.  The customer is in power. Think TSA - painful, communicating dis-empowerment and worry - the government is in power (albeit to keep you safe). 

So, I was talking to another successful entrepreneur the other day who is also in the process of raising money. He said to me "raising money is the most wretched thing we do."  Now - all my process proselytizing aside, I <em>feel </em>the same way.  For the entrepreneur, it is painful, ugly, humiliating and tiresome.  It's really something I don't enjoy.

But the process of fund-raising is not inherently wretched. When you look at it through the investor's eye - and mainly through the lens of risk mitigation, it becomes quite elegant.  If the the purpose is to remove risk as much as possible (and I think it is), then the items below from a process sense map perfectly to the goal.
<ol>
	<li>
<div><strong>Weed out those not serious: </strong>To ensure only those who are serious about raising capital actually work at it - the process (organic or intentional, it does not matter) must be difficult.  Keep funding sources in-obvious, hard to find, difficult to contact.</div>
</li>
	<li>
<div><strong>Weed out those without credentials:</strong>  To ensure that those resilient enough to find sources are legit, the process must have gate keepers.  Only accept funding opportunities from those you trust.</div>
</li>
	<li>
<div><strong>Weed out those who don't "seem right":</strong> Those that make it through steps one and two, must pass additional scrutiny around soft skills such as presenting, personal presentation, dress. They also need to pass a backrground check. Not a legal one - but like "where did you go to school", who do you know?</div>
</li>
	<li>
<div><strong>Weed out those with anything incomplete: </strong> That includes business plan, team, or product.</div>
</li>
	<li>
<div><strong>Weed out those that don't conform to investment criteria:</strong> That means by business segment, market type, etc.</div>
</li>
	<li>
<div><strong>Weed out those that that don't have all their ducks in a row:</strong>  Meaning - when performing legal and business due diligence (which actually started way back at 1 - but this is more detailed), remove risk by removing opportunities that have business or legal issues</div>
</li>
	<li>
<div>Once an investor does elect to invest, <strong>offer terms that only work for the investor. </strong> This is obvious</div>
</li>
</ol>
 So - it is wretched for the entrepreneur.  Of course, there are investors who don't play by those rules completely, and they are typically the ones who don't use risk mitigation as the limiting factor on investment.  When a different criteria is used, the process is different. 

Once you understand it - it's a lot easier to stomach the process.  Still is not really fun though.]]></content:encoded>

There will be a download piece and an add supported free stream piece.

Now, it's not without its challenges, and my first thought is this: MySpace is free, always has been and consumers will not spend money there. That's clearly a challenge to their download model. But it still makes me nervous.  Until this, we really had the only deep social networking/downloading presence - now we're up against MySpace - not good.  But wow - would I NOT want to be Immem, iLike, Jango or others - that would just be a killer.

In our case, we're still not a "web site" - rVibe is a social jukebox and download service.  It's still differentiated. It's still not primarily about people and their pages, it's about music and what people are listening too. 

And fortunately, the download market grows and the opportunities still abound.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When you look at business operating models, there are generally only three from which to choose:  Operational efficiency, Product innovation and Customer intimacy.  To understand these, it's effective to look at three companies that exemplify these models:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Operational efficiency:  Wal-Mart.</strong>  Wal-Mart's goal of lower pricing is driven by operational efficiency. Down to prioritizing their long-haul trucks over vendor long-haul trucks.  Or having only two cashiers on staff. Or being a leader in using RFID. They do NOT focus on making customers feel welcome, guided and supported. They do not focus on developing radical new products that change the market place.</li>
	<li><strong>Product Innovation:  Apple.</strong>  Apple's drive to create highly innovative devices (iPod + iTunes, iPhone, TV, etc) has changed the way people think about products.  With the exception of their stores (and I might argue they are not really an exception either), Apple is not focused on operational efficiency, or customer intimacy.</li>
	<li><strong>Customer Intimacy: Nordstroms.</strong>  When you walk into a Nordstroms you get "service".  Maybe that's a personal shopping consultant, maybe that's someone who walks you to the part of the store you need to find. Above all else, Norstroms will make you feel welcomed, loved and taken care of.  They are not creating a wild new product, or being extremely efficient.</li>
</ol>
When thinking about pure-play Internet companies - whether that is blogging, news, media, retail or content I believe you tend to see only two of the models above:  Operational efficiency and Product innovation, but mostly product innovation.  Think YouTube:  product innovation.  Think Google search and think operational efficiency. Think Imeem and think product innovation, or Facebook, product innovation, or Cnn.com - operational efficiency.

But - I think what's missing from pure play Internet companies is customer intimacy.  A way to make the customer feel welcome, loved and taken care of.  It's definitely missing from a customer support standpoint, but I mean more broadly.  Web 2.0 is/was about ease of use and sociability. It was not about the consumer per se.  And even then companies have blogs (typically as a means to drive traffic) that is not about customer intimacy.

I think there are a couple reasons for this:  1. the Internet is for geeks.  Or at least it was started by geeks and the kind of geeks who are not thinking about customer intimacy.  The very notion of anonymity on the Internet is the antithesis of customer intimacy.  2.  It's perceived to be too expensive and the perceived value of the Internet is in efficiency.

And for those who say that Web 2.0/social networking creates customer intimacy on the Internet:  maybe - but not if you want to sell something other than ads. And that's not company to customer intimacy, that's customer to customer intimacy - and that does not really lead to selling anything.

This is all true when it comes to on-line music companies too.  But we're going to change that. We're going to drive to customer intimacy in the on-line music experience.  I think it's a great strategic move. A great differentiatorand a real value add to the consumer.  As long as we're not cheese balls about it and as long as we can scale it effectively - which I think we can.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[well, <a href="http://sonific.com/">Sonific</a> is <a href="http://blog.wired.com/music/2008/04/sonific-calls-i.html">closing its doors</a>.  And I have to say, I'm not suprised.  There are a large number of startups doing the user upload thing to try to avoid the copyright infringement issue, but the record labels are starting to take a more aggressive stance against them and against linking companies like Seeqpod.

The copyright law, for all it's flaws and problems is nothing if not clear:  knowingly making a copy of a copyrighted work for commercial purposes is punishable by up to $150k in fines per infringement.  Now, some companies are trying to get out of that by taking the view that their users uploaded it, they just provide the platform.  But that doesn't really work.

Meaning, without the platform in place, the infringement couldn't happen. So, unless you place safeguards against infringement, you are providing the means to do it.  Some will disagree with me, but look at it from an investor risk assessment:
<ol>
	<li>I can assume the risk and hope I don't get sued</li>
	<li>I can assume the risk and hope someone with deep pockets buys me</li>
	<li>I can assume the risk and hope that the system changes</li>
</ol>
Since most of these are very unlikely to begin with - the second most likely - but not really, an investor is not likely to pursue investment with such a company.

Thus - when services like this start to run out of money - which they will - more will go belly up.

In our view, while the copyright law does not make much sense for our new music order out there on the internet, it's far better to play ball with the copyright holders then it is to see them in court.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, we've been sitting on "<a title="RVibe" href="http://www.rvibe.com/">RVibe: Just a little music between friends</a>" for a long time.  I actually really like this tag line and it's served us well in our social music jukebox phase.  And it's got some romance to it too.  My wife and I came up with it after we dropped the original name (Muizzium - which sounded too much like an nasal drug of some kind).    But, like most good things, it must be retired.

<img class="size-full wp-image-240 alignright" title="RVibe Logo" src="http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/logo.jpg" alt="RVibe Logo" width="220" height="55" />

Since we've whole hog moved into live streaming and on deamand (audio and video) distribution, we need a new tag line.  A good one.  One that captures the essence of what we do, but does not limit us so much that we can't do anything more with it.

So we brainstorm, we come up with words, we throw out words.

"Immersed:"  I love this one because it captures everyting about a social music experience and a live (full screen) experience.  Unless you're a SCUBA diver, and then it means getting in the water.  Oops.

"Fully Engaged".  Not only is 'engaged' over used, but what the heck does this mean anyway and what does this company do?  No clue.

So we're trying on a whole bunch of different things. And trying out the thesaurus; which you need to see this <a href="http://bit.ly/y5gtu">visual map of words</a>.  Very cool.

We produce, broadcast and distribute high-qulity real-time and recorded video and audio for paying consumers and businesses.

Any thoughts?]]></content:encoded>

And it happened. <a href="http://mediamemo.allthingsd.com/20090617/another-music-startup-sued-emi-takes-grooveshark-to-court/">Reports</a> are <a href="http://mediamemo.allthingsd.com/20090617/another-music-startup-sued-emi-takes-grooveshark-to-court/?reflink=ATD_mktw_quotes">coming</a> (WSJ) in that EMI is suing <a href="http://www.grooveshark.com/community/2009/06/17/an-announcement-from-grooveshark/#comments">Grooveshark</a> for copyright infringement.

I have a fondness for Grooveshark - they had a model super similar to ours at RVibe for p2p legal desktop sharing.  Except that where we did file validation and restricted downloads to explicitly licensed tracks (but not non-interactive streams), they allowed them. And, I asked our lawyer over and over - does their model of "putting the paid money into an escrow account" work? His answer over and over again - it's still infringement with out a licensing agreement.

So, while I admine their desire to move the industry forward, from a business intelligence and risk mitigation standpoint, they kind of blew it.  At up-to $125k an infringement, and will "millions of tracks", they are in for a very rough ride.

And where other companies (eg: <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/06/16/paidcontent/main5091157.shtml">Imeem and their Warner (re)investment</a>) were able to covert the legal morass into a licensing agreement, knowing how the major labels think, Grooveshark has too many technical/model hurdles (not to mention financial ones) to overcome to secure a deal.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since RVibe is an Internet based media company, we do a lot of work in the social media space.  And, when I a say a lot of work, what I mean is a lot of <em>work.</em> I have long believed there is a common (mis)-perception around social media (and I'll lump "viral" programs into this as well) that it's an easy, cheap, and quick way to get exposure.

I'm here to say - it's not true.  Now, yes, there are cases of hits that strike the web. But at this point, it's got to be fairly well known (although from the investment pitches I have seen lately, not among entrepreneurs) that you just can't predictably create viral products .  And for that matter, attempting to leverage social media to make a product react virally does not work reliably either.

And moreover, to actively use a Social network based marketing program, it is very very labor intensive. For a startup alone, we're talking at least 2 full time staff, even if they are really really good.

Finally, I think people are starting to realize that -  Jeremiah is a good one for a clear view of <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2009/06/13/looking-behind-the-curtains-at-the-social-media-stage-humans-dont-scale/">this</a> so what's a start up to do when "viral" marketing programs, based on Social network products actually require time and money?

Same thing as they  should always do:  plan accordingly and spend on marketing where their audience is.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Generally speaking boot-strapped start-ups are all between 60 days and 9 months from guaranteed bankruptcy, and at the same time about to shoot up the hockey stick and make hundreds of millions in revenue.  Of course, neither is actually true, but when you are constantly looking at your financial reports and projections, it's hard not to feel that way.

And in that mode, it feels so much like it must feel to hang-glide (disclaimer, I only fantasize about it, but have never done it). But in a start up, you have to start buckling your straps as you are running, being chased by wild boars.  So, maybe not quite the same thing.

If you get yourself buckled up, hit the updraft and don't get gorged, you will sail up and the world will fall away below you in glory.  If you don't buckle, you fall to your death below. And if you get impaled on the tusks of a boar...  not pretty.

It's just the nature of it.  And why start-ups are fun, and rewarding and terrifying and not for the feint of heart.  There is something strange about people who hang-glide, and something strange about entrepreneurs.

But, like all things that have a rush and transcendence to them, there is a lot of work that must happen before, during and after.  Thinking, preparing, training and working out the kinks.

And there are friends to be made.  It can be said that to know an entrepreneur is to know all entrepreneurs, and I think to a certain extent that is true.

I like how how it's talked about in this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4p27m5Y5b4">video</a>]]></content:encoded>
