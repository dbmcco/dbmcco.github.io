![rVibeÂ Logo](http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/rvibelogo.thumbnail.jpeg)It's fairly well understood that of the multiple kinds of marketing, when you look at interrupt versus non-intrusive, educational or word-of-mouth marketing, or viral that the latter is almost always more effective. It's also a lot cheaper. So - why would we want to spend lots of money on interrupt driven marketing (TV, print, banner ads, street give aways, etc)? Because it builds brand awareness quickly. 

But, since we don't have the cash on hand to do a massive interrupt driven campaign, and I'm not convinced it's a good use of money anyway, we're going down the less intrusive path - one that many tech startup's are doing: 1. get our network to do our work for us. But in this case, we're paying out network to do that. If you use rVibe and you like it - then advertise it for us - we'll pay you. Pretty simple. Pretty straight forward. And the infrastructure is already in place. Pretty cool.
