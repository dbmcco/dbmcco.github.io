As we work through some of the performance things with Beta 1 (some people would be content with it, but I am not), we're faced with the $$$ predicament. We're at the point where in order to seek additional investment, we really need to turn our product out. But the issue is this - we'll get Beta 1 out - but we may run out of capital before we have enough users to interest investors. That is the tricky thing. I am hoping that once we have Beta 1 out, even with minor usage, we'll see some additional interest (we've had a couple firms approach us so far) from VC's that will lead to investment.
