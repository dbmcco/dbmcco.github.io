We all know that the music industry has dramatically [struggled](http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20061017.html) with [music piracy](http://www.riaa.com/issues/piracy/default.asp) on peer-to-peer networks over the last few years and blame their revenue decline on [all that illegal activity](http://www.slyck.com/story1314.html). We now see that [25 million Americans download priated movies](http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,2087020,00.asp) as well. Here is the thing about piracy people just don't seem to realize. Or maybe they are unwilling to discuss, or feel like they will get sued - I am not sure - but I don't hear them talk about it. What seems to be clearly missing from the equation is that when 25 million users download movies illegally, and 9 million users are on p2p networks at any given moment, downloading 32 billion music files a year, that is a huge huge huge market. But the record and movie industries say it tells you people want music and movies for free and they are all bad bad pirates. However, I would suggest that what it really says is that people are desperate for on-line delivery of content that is fast, flexible and nonrestrictive. What it really says is: unfilled market need. It doesn't get much clearer than that. Even in the light of highly visible law suits, people continue to use p2p (+bittorrent) networks to get content. Demand, Demand, Demand. So here is the solution: leave out the restrictions, add in value to the consumer and monetize that value. Once you do that, even if you only convert 10% of the "Demand" then you have a winner.
