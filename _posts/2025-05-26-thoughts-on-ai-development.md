# Thoughts on AI Development

As I've been working more with AI tools like Claude Code, I'm struck by how rapidly the landscape is evolving.

## Key Observations

**Integration is Everything**: The most powerful AI tools aren't standalone applications, but those that integrate seamlessly into existing workflows. Claude Code's ability to work directly with my development environment is a perfect example.

**Human-AI Collaboration**: The future isn't about AI replacing developers, but about creating better collaboration patterns. I find myself thinking differently about problems when I have an AI partner to bounce ideas off.

**Infrastructure Matters**: The quality of AI-human interaction depends heavily on the underlying infrastructure - from APIs to file systems to version control integration.

## Looking Forward

I'm particularly excited about:
- AI that understands project context across multiple files
- Better integration with existing development tools
- More sophisticated reasoning about code architecture and design patterns

The key is finding the right balance between AI assistance and human creativity.
