Well, although we have over 10,000 myspace friends, we have not activated them and have done no other advertisements. We have not added del.icio.us or stumble upon or digg links to the website or anything. For all intents and purposes we have done _no_ advertising in anyway shape or form. Oh - and our brochureware website went up 3 weeks ago. So I have been very surprised to have gotten so many requests to try out the beta. And to those many many many beta requesters - thank you for finding us and thank you for being so interested. We'll start engaging more of you very soon.
