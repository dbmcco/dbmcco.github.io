Here in the US, Henryk Gorecki gets a bit short-changed as a composer of self-reflective trance-like symphony and choral pieces. On the one hand, it's well deserved - Symphony No. 3 and Totus Tuus both easily fall into that category. However, it's not fully deserved, he has written a lot of other music that definitely does NOT fall into that category. Also, I like to think of it a bit differently. Since high-school I have loved Russian choral music. Now, this is not Russian, it's Polish and make no mistake there is a difference. For one, Polish music is far more understated and less overtly dramatic than Russian music. For another, it's got a stronger Western European influence built in so it doesn't have as much of an "ethnic" flare to it (to Western ears anyway). However, they really do tie together and for what I am about to say, it goes for Russian and Polish music in general (as a gross over generalization). The Russian and Polish choral traditions are completely wonderful things. The purity of tone and simplicity of voicing as well as character of the choirs themselves far and away are better than English, German, French or American choral music of choirs. The traditional choral music from both countries is delightful and moving at the same time. The Prague Philharmonic Choir performs [Totus Tuus, Op. 60](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000012UB?ie=UTF8&tag=rvibe07-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0000012UB) ![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rvibe07-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0000012UB)in an marvelously gorgeous way. While the Prague Philharmonic is Checz, they still clearly grasp the Eastern Euopean choral tradition. This performance is not trance-like music - it is musical interpretation of the highest calibre. The natural phrasing and beautifully blended choir make a complex presentation of otherwise simple music. The straight tones of the group combine to offer a sense of intensity that I think choirs of the English tradition lack.
