# About Braydon McCormick

My career looks scattered on paper. Music theory PhD, healthcare entrepreneur, film composer, AI experimenter. But there's a thread: I'm drawn to problems where different worlds need to connect.

## The Winding Path

**Music & Film** - Composed for movies including my sister's films. Now helping her launch Resilience Creative, a climate-focused film company, because storytelling and business strategy aren't that different.

**RVIBE (2004-2016)** - Started as P2P music sharing, became interactive concert broadcasting, ended up as virtual training. We were early to remote engagement. Sometimes being early feels like being wrong.

**Intempio (2016-present)** - Built virtual meeting platforms for pharmaceutical companies before anyone wanted virtual meetings. COVID validated the approach. Now we work with half the top 20 life sciences companies.

**Aclara Advanced Materials (2020-present)** - Co-invented antimicrobial fabric technology (US 11,975,221) for healthcare PPE. From idea to patent to manufacturing.

**LightForge Works (2023-present)** - Using AI tools to build custom software for businesses. My theory: entrepreneurs shouldn't need computer science degrees to solve software problems.

## The Through Line

Whether it's music composition, business strategy, or AI-assisted development, I'm always trying to create structure from complexity. Music theory taught me pattern recognition. Healthcare taught me systems thinking. Film taught me storytelling. AI is teaching me what's possible.

## Current Reality

I use Claude Code and similar tools to build everything from healthcare platforms to personal finance apps. I'm not a trained developer, but I can solve problems and document what works. Other business leaders will follow similar paths.

My career makes more sense in retrospect than it did while living it.
