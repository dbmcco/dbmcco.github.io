In talking with EMI a few months ago, they were comfortable with licensing out content (once they queue is reduced: meaning we don't have enough cash to bump to the top of the list) in DRM free MP3 format. And while there have been lots of rumors of buyouts over the last few months, it seems [this one with Terra Firma ](http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/terra-firma-emi-offer-period/story.aspx?guid=%7B4B6E1590-6FBD-4144-AF1A-A4EE3E8037A2%7D)might happen. We're hoping that doesn't effect their DRM or digital licensing strategy negatively - of course. I suspect that it will delay any EMI offering we might be able to do, but I can't imagine they will revert to DRM.
