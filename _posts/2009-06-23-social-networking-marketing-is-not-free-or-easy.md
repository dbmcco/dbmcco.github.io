Since RVibe is an Internet based media company, we do a lot of work in the social media space. And, when I a say a lot of work, what I mean is a lot of _work._ I have long believed there is a common (mis)-perception around social media (and I'll lump "viral" programs into this as well) that it's an easy, cheap, and quick way to get exposure. I'm here to say - it's not true. Now, yes, there are cases of hits that strike the web. But at this point, it's got to be fairly well known (although from the investment pitches I have seen lately, not among entrepreneurs) that you just can't predictably create viral products . And for that matter, attempting to leverage social media to make a product react virally does not work reliably either. And moreover, to actively use a Social network based marketing program, it is very very labor intensive. For a startup alone, we're talking at least 2 full time staff, even if they are really really good. Finally, I think people are starting to realize that - Jeremiah is a good one for a clear view of [this](http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2009/06/13/looking-behind-the-curtains-at-the-social-media-stage-humans-dont-scale/) so what's a start up to do when "viral" marketing programs, based on Social network products actually require time and money? Same thing as they should always do: plan accordingly and spend on marketing where their audience is.
