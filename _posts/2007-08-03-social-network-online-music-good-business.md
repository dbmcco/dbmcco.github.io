Here are some good recent [stats](http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-legal-music-downloads-growth-hit-by-cd-price-reductions-report/): \-- **Social networks:** Such sites play a growing role in music discovery and consumption, with 39 percent of all social network users having embedded a track on their profile But thereâ€™s an age gap - under-35s rate MySpace best for music, over-35s say YouTube; overall, only 16 percent of people rate Bebo top for music. Some 13 percent of users have actually purchased music they discovered at MySpace, 15 percent for Bebo, seven percent for YouTube - but **46 percent overall wish it were easier to buy the tunes they find at such sites**. So - we have a solid solution - mix in an embeddable player/store into it, and tie it into our p2p system and make it a holisitic download system. Then pay users to promote the music they love and it's a winner. Beta is moving along, next big release is August 15th.
