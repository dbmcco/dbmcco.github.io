# My First Blog Post

This is my first blog post written in Obsidian and published via Jekyll!

## How This Works

I'm writing this in my Obsidian vault at `bvault/blog/`, and it will be automatically synced to my Jekyll blog on GitHub Pages.

## Features I Love

- **Obsidian integration**: Write in my familiar environment
- **Markdown support**: Full markdown with front matter
- **Version control**: Everything tracked in Git
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting and automatic builds

## Next Steps

I plan to write about:
- Technology insights
- Business observations
- Personal projects
- Learning experiences

Stay tuned for more content!
