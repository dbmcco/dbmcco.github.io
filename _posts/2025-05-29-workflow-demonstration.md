# Workflow Demonstration Post

This post demonstrates the complete Obsidian to Jekyll workflow.

## What I'm Doing

1. **Writing in Obsidian** - I'm creating this post in my vault at `bvault/blog/`
2. **Using Jekyll front matter** - The YAML at the top tells Jekyll how to process this
3. **Following naming convention** - File is named `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`

## Next Steps

After writing, I'll:
- Run the sync script
- See it copy to Jekyll
- Push to GitHub
- Watch it appear on the live blog

## Why This Works

**Obsidian Benefits:**
- Great writing environment
- Local file control
- Powerful linking and organization

**Jekyll Benefits:**
- Static site generation
- GitHub Pages hosting
- Professional appearance

The sync script bridges these two worlds perfectly!
