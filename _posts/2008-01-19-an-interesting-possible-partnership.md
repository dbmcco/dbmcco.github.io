In our quest for extending the range of our partnerships, an interesting dropped out of the sky yesterday. I've been chatting with a company about various things and they brought up an idea they would like to explore doing with us. This is an American company that works in music reporduction. Without divulging too much, we're going to look at delivery of live music. It's someting that is new and very coool and I think we'd be a good match. More to come....
