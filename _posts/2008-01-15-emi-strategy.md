[![EMI](http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/emilogo.thumbnail.gif)](http://www.emi.com)Hypebot is [keeping tabs](http://hypebot.typepad.com/hypebot/2008/01/job-cuts-confir.html) on the progress EMI is making on their future direction - thanks Bruce! Although the cuts are hard for everyone of course (and not just for the folks being cut), there seems to be some strong positive direction in the new strategy outlined. Most notably are the focus on A&R as well as the emphasis on making digital a more comprehensive channel (as opposed to a hacked together group for licensing). I am thrilled that EMI is taking such a strong lead on working through their longer term strategy for growth and looking at innovative organizational structures to make it a reality. However, I do worry that the net effect is a step backwards on the licensing front - even if it's only a six months - any lag is a long time in this environment.
