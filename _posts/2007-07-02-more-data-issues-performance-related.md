Ugh - we're hitting big performance problems due to how our data is structured. There is a fine line between having rich data sets that have many different joins and having something that performs within a reasonable amount of time. We had erred on the rich set side a little much. We're working to streamline it right now and see if we can reduce the result set delivery time a bit.
