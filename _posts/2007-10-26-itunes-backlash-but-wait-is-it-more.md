WMG is the latest major label to start backing out of their iTunes agreement and it certainly seems the backlash continues. But I wonder... the major labels definitely follow one another as they move into new territory (latest example is DRM free music - EMI went first), but I am not sure they follow one another when they back out of something like iTunes (as much as they don't like it). So it makes me wonder if there is a different force at work - prep for a new direction. I don't think that new direction is the 'total music' thing, but there could be more. Universal licensing for all content? We could only be so lucky.
