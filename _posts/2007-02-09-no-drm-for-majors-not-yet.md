![EMI](http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/emilogo.thumbnail.gif)Major news outlets are saying that some of the major labels (EMI is most noted) are [starting to have talks](http://online.wsj.com/google_login.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB117098284722103100.html%3Fmod%3Dgooglenews_wsj)with companies about selling music without DRM. That's us. Well, that _was_ us. Just yesterday our negotiations with EMI broke down and told us they are not ready to do a deal at this time (our sticking point is DRM).

And now Warner is [going on record](http://www.tradearabia.com/tanews/newsdetails_snMEDIA_article118711.html) as saying that they are not going to remove DRM. I just emailed with the CFO last night and we're going to meet next week or the week after to chat - and this will be one of the things we chat about. I doubt we'll get much traction, but you've got to start somewhere. And with Warner's sales down 74%, maybe our non-DRM/yet still protected solution will resonate. In general, with the Jobs announcement, there is another affect: licensing deals with the majors have come to a halt. That's a real pain.
