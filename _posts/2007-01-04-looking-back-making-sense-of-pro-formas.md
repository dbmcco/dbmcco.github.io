In late 2005 we did our first _pro forma_ financials. Our accountants, [Isdaner and Co](http://www.isdanerllc.com/home.html "Isdaner") (namely [Hank Abrams](http://www.isdanerllc.com/abrams.html "Hank Abrams")) did a great job of pulling together what was a messy set of materials into a meaningful whole. Unfortunately, our core assumptions were wrong. We made the classic top-down, young exuberant company market size goof. Meaning, we picked a market size and amount we wanted to capture. We said that the total p2p swapping volume is around 32 billion files swapped per year, and if we can convert 0.75% of that into revenue at $0.99 per swap, then - wow - we're making a whole lot of money! Of course, that's a bogus way to calculate market size, and we've since done a bottom up analysis. We took a look at our demographic in terms of accessible numbers, did a little primary market research to gauge interest (pretty high, btw) and determined total probabal user population. We factored a relatively even growth curve, assumed some [sales averages](http://www.akamai.com/html/about/press/releases/2006/press_121106.html "Akamai market data") and derived our _pro formas_ that way. Until you have real revenue, knowing your customers is the only way to forecast revenue. Lesson learned.
