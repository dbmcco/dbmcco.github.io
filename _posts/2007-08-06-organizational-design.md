In reviewing our operations, I thought I'd just mention our organziational framework. We've organized ourselves around our business practices. That said - we also have an overlay structure with a product and customer focus. Meaning, here are the four practice areas (and organizational structure): 

  1. Technology
  2. Content
  3. Marketing
  4. Operations (financial, legal, organizational)

Our focus areas are: 
  1. Customer Development and Support
  2. Product Development and Support
  3. Content Development and Support
  4. Organzational Development and Support

On the surface the focus areas map to the organization directly, but as we grow, they actually point more to innovation and delivery and work across the organization. Meaning, everyone in each practice area is responsible for innovation and delivery in each of the focus areas. That leads to greater collaboration, idea sharing and energy. Silos = bad; innovation through sharing = good. I am not sure how well this structure will scale above 1oo people, but I think it will if we have smaller virtual teams within a larger organization. What value does it add? Quicker reponse time, stronger product innovation and better internal communication. All good things in my book.
