I guess that title could point to lots of stuff. [But here is another version of a social network for music](http://mashable.com/2009/06/09/songkick/). This time it seems like Digg Meets Delicious, Meets YouTube, Meets Last.fm, Meets Jambase, Meets BroadJam. Wait, now that I say that, don't [Jambase](http://www.jambase.com/default.aspx) and [BroadJam](http://www.broadjam.com) and [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/events) do basically the same thing already, but a little better? Content may be king, but I think that trusted content is the real king.
