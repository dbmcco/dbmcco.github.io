It was a great father's day; spent it with our big little family at the pool and went out for Italian. My boys (well, my wife) gave me a beautiful picture set from our vacation, a watch and a great book. And part of the great Father's day was that I got to read that book - and I read the whole thing. [The Road](http://www.amazon.com/Road-Cormac-McCarthy/dp/0307265439/ref=sr_1_2/102-3359460-9214564?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1182174659&sr=8-2)by Cormac McCarthy is incredible. I loved it and highly recommend it as a view of fatherly love in a hostile world. Certainly apropos for father's day.
