![PointÂ Juncture](http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/pointunjntcr.jpg)In designing rVibe, I really saw it from a music discovery, social networking and give-back perspective. I wasn't sure how that would affect my discovery, but it already has. One of the gripes (for as good as they are) I have always had with services like [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com), or [MyStands](http://www.mystrands.com/) is that they typically show you more of what you already have. I don't necessarily want or need more of what I already have. What I need is more music that impacts me the way I want to be impacted, but music that is new, fresh and different. And since, in my view of the music world (and I do not take the John Cage view of the music world), since music is a social experience, then the discovery of music should be a social experience. So - my first rVibe find (and interestingly it's not "classical"): [Point Juncture, WA](http://www.pointjuncturewa.com/main.html). First new tune: Diswasher's Lullaby. Point Juncture, WA does this Math Rock music with some funky rhythms mixed in with some kind of drone sounds for a kind of low key trance like thing. The lead singer has a beautiful straight tone that rides nicely above any of the mess that gets made and complements the more heavy handed low end drums and rough guitars the group uses. It's not angry like Amy Lee stuff; where it has it's edge is in the dissonances they use at the end of a phrase - I love that kind of thing. The only criticism I have is that I can't really understand a word she says. And maybe that's part of the Point.
