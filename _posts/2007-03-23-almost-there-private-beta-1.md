It's so close, I can almost taste it. Private beta 1 is in the final stages of completion. There are any number of things that will have to be fixed (mostly cosmetic and data related), but I can accept that right now. Mainly I want to get it out there, see it work and get some user feedback. I really do love this stuff - building a cool product, developing the market around it and plugging it in - it just doesn't get much cooler than that. But wow, am I tired today.
