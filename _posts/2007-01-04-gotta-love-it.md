[Bleecker Street: Greenwich Village In The 60's](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000IQMK?ie=UTF8&tag=rvibe07-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00000IQMK)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rvibe07-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00000IQMK) is a great album - covers of wonderful '60's tunes by current artists. The interpretations are really solid and when [Jonatha Brooke](http://www.jonathabrooke.com/ "Jonatha Brooke") takes a turn at the Simon & Garfunkle's title track, she gives it a soulful and yet gentle touch. I've appreciated Jonatha's touch for a while now. She has a delicate, breathy tone but manages to sound full at the same time. Her voice also has that magical quality of blending well with other voices. A very nice straight tone that can also have some bite to it. And on "Bleecker Street" the simple arrangement of guitars is a perfect compliment to her grounded and unaffected sound. And the engineering is superb. Click the link to Amazon.com, if you want.
