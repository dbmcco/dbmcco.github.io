I just finished [The Professor and the Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity, and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary (P.S.)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060839783?ie=UTF8&tag=rvibe07-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0060839783)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rvibe07-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0060839783). Great true story of a couple key figured in the making of the Oxford English Dictionary. Easy read, good overview, seemingly well researched (primary research) and interesting context. I love these types of books.
