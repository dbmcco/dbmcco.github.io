With all the hype around tagging things - everything, you would think it would have hit email by now. I can't tell you how often I dig through email to find something that I know is in there and if I could only sort it by topic I could find it easily.... yup - if I could just tag it. Yes, you can sort with folders - kind of. But I want to be able to do multiple tags per email so I can find stuff with Boolean searches. And email often has multiple topics associated with it. And wow - if you could do that at the enterprise level and get access to centralized email - that would be incredibly powerful for knowledge sharing and re-use. As long as there were measures to protect email privacy (ie: mark this private). Not sure how you would monetize it - expect for add-on software sales, but I would love to have that.
