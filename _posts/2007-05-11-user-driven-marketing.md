We strive to do innovative things - not just for the sake of being innovative - but for the sake of driving value to our customer, our company and our investors. To that end, we are working to lower costs, while increasing revenue (could it be more basic?). In our space, one of those big costs can be/is marketing. To be really effective, centralized advertisements (where you place ads that are distributed from a central place - like MSN, or Federated Media) is also really expensive. And ultimately, the cost of marketing lowers the value of the service to the consumer. Meaning - they don't get anything worthwhile out of it (other than maybe a good feeling that they are a part of something with an advertised brand identity). So - we're putting advertisting in the hands of our users. Not telling how - but more to come.
