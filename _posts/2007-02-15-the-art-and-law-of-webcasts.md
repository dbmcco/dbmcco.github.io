We're exploring adding a webcast piece into our the rVibe service and I think it's the right way to go. I'm not going to go into too much detail, but suffice it to say that any user (non-subscription) can listen to an embedded webcast on any site where it's embedded. And that webcast can be in-effect created by any user. And that allows some additional functionality that is the killer-app part. The only question is to what degree it will conform to section 114 for statutory licensing. Now, I am no lawyer, but I think we've sorted it out - and yes we will. It just comes down to the degree of "consumer influence" over what is played and the audience for whom it is played. In our case, I believe we're on safe ground for statutory licensing as long as our business logic conforms to the playlist rules (no artist repeats in a three hour time, etc). That might mean modifying the user generated webcast list, but better that then face the licensing consequence.
