![UMGÂ Logo](http://meansofproduction.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/umglogo.thumbnail.gif)We met with the digital group at Universal well over a year ago and they were totally into rVibe. They approved our model and we went to business review. The big hang up we all wound up having however was DRM and they insisted on it. Well, that and they needed a hefty upfront payment. Now they are [experimenting with selling files without DRM](http://www.dmwmedia.com/news/2007/08/10/universal-to-test-sale-of-drm-free-tracks-everywhere-but-itunes). Of course, they call it an experiment, but I believe that once they go through that door they can't go back. Which means that pretty soon they are going to expand past Rhapsody. Which means that I need to reach out to them again, see if we can get that license done. EMI is almost there, I would love to get Universal in there too.
