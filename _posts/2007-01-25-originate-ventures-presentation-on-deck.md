I am currently waiting to do our presentation for [Originate Ventures](http://originateventures.com/). Originate is Mike Gausling's new VC fund and appears to be a good match. As I understand Mike, he is a very operational oriented guy with a sharp eye toward margin. I hope he also has a sharp eye on sales volume.... Deck is ready to go, I am ready (as much as anyone is every ready I suppose), and I think we've got a good story to tell. We'll see if there is follow on interest.
