[Rick Genzer](http://genzer.com/) asked me to be a guest speaker in his Money Matters class. That's always a fun thing and Rick's class was no exception. The kids were smart and not only got it but asked lots of great questions. I think I did an ok job of talking through rVibe and what we're all about. Thanks to Rick for the invite.
