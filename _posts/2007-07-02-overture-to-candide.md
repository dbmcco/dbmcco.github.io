Lots of people love Leonard Bernstein and lots of people hate him. To know him (well - he's dead, but to know about him) is to have an opinion. Me - I think he was great for classical music - his charisma brought people to it in ways we have not seen recently. I also think he's a brilliant conductor - his [Brahms' Fourth Symphony with the New York Philharmonic](http://www.amazon.com/Brahms-Symphony-Academic-Festival-Bernstein/dp/B0000027M6/ref=sr_1_4/002-1187223-0447268?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1183392440&sr=1-4) is awesome.

However, I have never been a huge fan of his music. His writing has always felt fragmented and dated - even "[West Side Story](http://www.amazon.com/Brahms-Symphony-Academic-Festival-Bernstein/dp/B0000027M6/ref=sr_1_4/002-1187223-0447268?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1183392440&sr=1-4)." It seemed to me he was sticking tricks into the score for the sake of intellectual achievement rather than musical necessity.

But then I watched my sons listen to "[Overture to Candide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overture_to_Candide)" and my opinion changed. They were so engaged and enlivened by this little piece that I was able to overlook anything I thought of as artificially high brow; for them, it's just plain fun.

Lukas Foss does a really nice job with [this version](http://www.amazon.com/American-Festival-Unanswered-Variations-Appalachain/dp/B000000BKJ/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/002-1187223-0447268?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1183391817&sr=1-2). The recording is a bit quiet, but acceptable. And Lukas Foss is one of the most musical composers I have ever known. For him it must first make sense musically then intellectually. And one of the things I picked up from him is that music must have humor - which I took to mean (in addition to humor) - personality. You have to include as much personality as possible in your music. Which he does - check out Thirteen ways of looking at a Blackbird.

And I think Lukas' version of Overture to Candide captures that sense.
