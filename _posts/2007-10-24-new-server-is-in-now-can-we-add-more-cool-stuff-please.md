Phew - that's done. We're tuning it now - but performance is also better just as is. We're also moving the scanning process out of the main process to improve application responsiveness at the outset. It's a never ending struggle to balance fixes and enhancements with net new functionality. Right now net new has taken a two week backseat (kind of - we've made huge progress on the UI model classes), but we should see a WHOLE BUNCH of great stuff come on line over the next three weeks or so. Things to watch for: 

  1. Embeddable playlists for blogs and website (with eCommerce functionality)
  2. Radio format listening for friends, recommendations and other stuff
  3. Flyout menus for reducing number of clicks to do _things_

General stability and data cleansing as well.
